"01. IMPORTANCE AND AREA, PRODUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MAJOR 
CEREALS, MILLETS, PULSES AND OILSEEDS OF INDIA  
 
IMPORTANCE 
CEREALS 
 
The word Cereal derives from Ceres, the name of the Roman goddess of harvest and 
agriculture. Cereals are grasses (members of the monocot family Poaceae, also known as 
Gramineae) cultivated for the edible components of their grain (botanically, a type of fruit called 
a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater 
quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop, they are 
therefore staple crops. 
 
 
 
In their natural form (as in whole grain), they are a rich source of carbohydrates, 
vitamins, minerals, fats, oils and protein. However, when refined by the removal of the bran and 
germ, the remaining endosperm is mostly carbohydrate and lacks the majority of the other 
nutrients. In some developing nations, grain in the form of rice, wheat, millet or maize 
constitutes a majority of daily sustenance. In developed nations, cereal consumption is moderate 
and varied but still substantial. Globally, more than 2000 m.t. of cereals are produced from about 
700 m. ha with the average productivity of about 3000 kg/ha.  
 
PULSES  
 
Pulses may be defined as the dried edible seeds of cultivated legumes. They belong to the 
family of peas, beans and lentils (Family: Fabaceae). English word pulse is taken from the Latin 
Puls, meaning pouage or thick pap. The pulses are a large family and various species are capable 
or surviving in very different climates and soils.  
 
 
 
Pulses are cultivated in all parts of the world and they occupy an important place in 
human diet. In India, especially people who are mostly vegetarian depend largely on cereals and 
pulses as their staple food, which serve as the main source of dietary protein and energy.  
 
 
Pulses contain more protein than any other plant. They serve as a low-cost protein to 
meet the needs of the large section of the people. They have, therefore, been justifiably described 
as 'the poor man's meat'. Their low moisture content and hard test or seed-coat permits storage 
over long periods. In addition to providing dry pulses, many of the crops are grown for their 
green edible pods and un-ripe seeds. Nutritionally, immature fruits have distinctly different 
properties to those of the mature seed; the protein content is lower, but, they are relatively richer 
in some of the crops are used as pot herbs.  
 
 
In general, pulses contain 20 to 28% protein with the exception of soybean which has as 
much as 42%. Their carbohydrate content is about 60% except soybean which has about 30%. 
Pulses are also fairly good sources of thiamin and niacin and provide calcium, phosphorus and 
iron. On an average, 100 g of pulses contain 345 Kcal of energy, 24.5 g of protein, 140 mg of 
calcium, 300 mg of phosphorus, 8 mg of iron, 0.5 mg of thiamin, 0.3 mg of riboflavin and 2 mg 
of niacin.

"OILSEEDS  
 
Oilseeds are important as are the pulses in the country. The principal oilseeds include 
groundnuts, rapeseeds and mustard seeds. While the former is a Kharif crop, depending wholly 
upon reasonable but timely rainfall, the latter is a Rabi crop, fundamentally confined only to non-
irrigated areas. As a result their production as well as productivity is subject to climatic 
variations and market hypotheses. The other oilseeds incorporate sesame, linseed, caster seed, 
safflower seed, soybeans, sunflower seeds, cotton seeds and copra. Rapeseeds and mustard seeds 
belong to the wheat belt of north and central India. Groundnut, on the other hand, is grown in 
west and south India. Gujarat is the dominant producer of groundnut. While population has been 
mounting at 2% per annum, the demand for oil has been rising at 5% every year.

RICE CULTIVATION – SYSTEM OF RICE INTENSIFICATION, TRANSGENIC 
RICE - HYBRID RICE 
 
ORIGIN  
 
Rice cultivation probably dates back to the antiquity and has probably been the staple food 
and the first cultivated crop in Asia. In India, rice has been cultivated since ancient times. This 
supported by archaeological evidences and by the numerous references made to rice in ancient 
Hindu scriptures and literature. Carbonised paddy grains were found in the excavation at 
Hasthinapur (Uttar Pradesh) at a site dated between 1000-750 B.C. This is the oldest rice specimen 
yet known in the world. From the study of Sanskrit and of other different languages in South-
Eastern Asia, many investigators have come to the conclusion that rice was known in India before 
the present era. 
 
 
 
De candolle (1886) and Watt (1892) thought that South India was the place where cultivated 
rice originated. Vavilov (1926) suggested that India and Burma should be regarded as the centre of 
origin of cultivated rice. 
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION 
 
Rice is the world’s leading food crop, cultivated over an area of about 155 million hectares 
with a production of about 596 million tonnes (paddy). In terms of area and production it is second 
to wheat. It provides about 22 per cent of the world’s supply of calories and 17% of the proteins. 
Maximum area under rice is in Asia. Among the rice growing countries, India has the largest area 
(44.8 million hectares) followed by China and Indonesia. In respect of production, India ranks 
second with 131 million tonnes of paddy next to China (200 million tonnes of paddy). In regard to 
average yield per hectare, Egypt ranks first followed by USA. Average rice yield of India is only 
2929 kg per hectare.  
 
 
 
The leading countries producing rice crop are Japan, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, 
Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Philippines. 
 
 
 
In India, rice is grown in almost all the states. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, 
Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal lead in the area. West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have the highest 
rice production. The average yield per hectare is highest in Punjab (3346 kg/ha). 
 
  
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
 
Rice farming is the largest single use of land for food. Rice production totaled 600 million 
tonnes. 90% rice is produced in Asia alone. Only 6-7% of production is exported from area of 
production. Rice field covers 11% of arable land. It is the most important economic activity of 
earth.  Rice eaters and growers form the bulk of the worlds’ poor. Single most important activity of 
rural people in the world. Rice is grown in 250 million Asian farms. Rice farming is 10,000 years

"CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS 
 
In India, rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice 
cultivation in India extends from 8 to 350N latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 metres. 
Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, 
prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout 
the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 370C. At the time of tillering the crop requires a higher 
temperature than for growth. Temperature requirement for blooming is in the range of 26.5 to 
29.50C. At the time of ripening, the temperature should be between 20-250C. Photo-periodically, 
rice is a short-day plant. However, there are varieties which are non-sensitive to photoperiodic 
conditions. 
SOIL REQUIREMENT 
 
In India, rice is grown under so diverse soil conditions that it can be said that there is hardly 
any type of soil in which it cannot be grown, including alkaline and acidic soils. Soils having good 
water retention capacity with good amount of clay and organic matter are ideal for rice cultivation. 
Clay or clay loams are most suited for rice cultivation, such soils are capable of holding water for 
long and sustain crop. Rice being a semi-aquatic crop grows best under submerged conditions. A 
major part of rice crop in India is grown under ‘lowland’ conditions. Rice plant is able to tolerate a 
wide range of soil reaction, but, it does have a preference for acidic soils. It grows well in soils 
having a pH range between 5.5 and 6.5. It can be grown on alkali soils also, after treating them with 
gypsum or pyrite.

TYPES OF RICE CULTIVATION 
I. TRANSPLANTED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE 
A. NURSERY MANAGEMENT  
i. WET NURSERY 
Nursery area: Select 20 cents (800 m2) of land area near to water source for raising seedlings for 
one hectare. 
 
Seed rate: 30 kg for long duration; 40 kg for medium duration; 60 kg for short duration varieties 
and 20 kg for hybrids. 
 
Seed treatment 
• 
Treat the seeds with Carbendazim or Pyroquilon or Tricyclozole solution @ 2 g/l of water 
for 1 kg of seeds.  
• 
This wet seed treatment gives protection to the seedlings up to 40 days from disease such as 
blast and this method is better than dry seed treatment. 
• 
If the seeds are required for sowing immediately, keep the soaked seed in gunny in dark and 
cover with extra gunnies and leave for 24hrs for sprouting. 
• 
Seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens: Treat the seeds with talc based 
formulation of Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg of seed and soak in 1.0 lit of water 
overnight. Decant the excess water and allow the seeds to sprout for 24hrs and then sow.  
• 
Seed treatment with Azospirillum: Treat with three packets (600 g/ha) of Azospirillum and 
3 packets (600g/ha) of Phosphobacteria or 6 packets (1200g/ha) of Azophos. In bio-
inoculants mixed with sufficient water wherein the seeds are soaked overnight before 
sowing in the nursery bed (The bacterial suspension after decanting may be poured over the 
nursery area itself).  
• 
Bio-control agents are compatible with bio-fertilizers  
• 
Bio-fertilizers and bio-control agents can be mixed together for seed soaking  
• 
Fungicides and bio-control agents are incompatible.  
 
Forming seedbeds 
• 
Mark plots of 1.5 to 2.0m breadth with channels of 30cm wide all around the seedbeds. 
• 
Length of the seed bed may vary from 8 to 10m according to soil and slope of the land. 
• 
Collect the puddled soil from the channel and spread on the seedbeds or drag a heavy stone 
along the channel to lower it, so that the seed bed is at a higher level. Level the surface of 
the seedbed, so that the water drains into the channel.  
 
Sowing  
 
Sow the sprouted seeds uniformly on the seedbed, having sufficient water in the nursery.  
 
Water management  
• 
Drain the water 18 to 24hrs after sowing. 
• 
Care must be taken to avoid stagnation of water in any part of the seedbed. 
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
"• 
Allow enough water to saturate the soil from 3rd to 5th day. From 5th day onwards, increase 
the water level from 1.5cm depending on the height of the seedlings. Thereafter maintain 
2.5cm depth of water. 
 
Weed management 
• 
Apply pre-emergence herbicides viz., Pretilachlor + safener @ 0.3kg/ha, on 3rd or 4th day 
after sowing to control weeds in the lowland nursery.  Keep a thin film of water and allow it 
to disappear.  Avoid drainage of water.  This will control germinating weeds.  
                                                                                                                                  
Nutrient management 
• 
Apply 1.0 tonne of fully decomposed FYM or compost to 20 cents nursery and spread the 
manure uniformly on dry soil. 
• 
Basal application of DAP is recommended when the seedlings are to be pulled out in 20-25 
days after sowing in less fertile nursery soils. For that situation, before the last puddling, 
apply 40kg of DAP and if not readily available, apply straight fertilizers 16kg of urea and 
120kg of super phosphate. 
• 
If seedlings are to be pulled out after 25 days, application of DAP is to be done 10 days prior 
to pulling out.  
• 
For clayey soils where root snapping is a problem, 4kg of gypsum and 1kg of DAP/cent of 
area can be applied at 10 days after sowing. 
 
ii. DRY NURSERY 
• 
Dry ploughed field with fine tilth is required. 
• 
Nursery area of 20 cents with sand and loamy soil status is more suitable for this type of 
nursery. 
• 
Plots of 1 to 1.5m width of beds and channels to be formed. Length is according to the slope 
and soil. Raised beds are more ideal if the soil is clayey in nature. 
• 
Seed rate and seed treatment as that of wet nursery. 
• 
Sowing is dry seeding. Seeds are covered with sand and finely powdered well decomposed 
farm yard manure. 
• 
Irrigation to be done to wet the soil to saturation. 
• 
Optimum age for transplanting – 4th leaf stage. 
• 
This type of nursery is handy in times of delayed receipt of canal water. 
 
B. MAIN FIELD MANAGEMENT  
Land preparation 
• 
Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of 
land.  
• 
Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of 
the field covered with water.  
• 
Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling.  
 
Problem soil management 
a). Fluffy paddy soils: Compact the soil by passing 400kg stone roller or oil-drum with stones 
inside, eight times at proper moisture level (moisture level at friable condition of soil which is 
approximately 13 to18%) once in three years, to prevent the sinking of draught animals and workers 
during puddling.  
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
" 
b). Sodic soils with pH values of more than 8.5, plough at optimum moisture regime, apply gypsum 
at 50% gypsum requirement uniformly, impound water, provide drainage for leaching out soluble 
salts and apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha, 10 to 15 days before transplanting. Mix 37.5kg of Zinc 
sulphate/ha with sand to make a total quantity of 75kg and spread the mixture uniformly on the 
leveled field. Do not incorporate the mixture in the soil. Rice under sodic soil responds well to these 
practices.  
 
c). Saline soils with EC values of more than 4 dS/m, provide lateral and main drainage channels 
(60cm deep and 45cm wide), apply green leaf manure at 5 t/ha at 10 to 15 days before transplanting 
and 25% extra dose of nitrogen in addition to recommended P and K and ZnSO4 at 37.5 kg/ha at 
planting. 
 
d). Acid soils: Apply lime based on the soil analysis for obtaining normal rice yields. Lime is 
applied 2.5t/ha before last ploughing. Apply lime at this rate to each crop up to the 5th crop.  
 
Optimum age of seedlings  
• 
Optimum age of the seedlings is 18-22 days for short, 25-30 days for medium and 35-40 
days for long duration varieties.  
 
Pulling out the seedlings: Pull out the seedlings at the appropriate time (4th leaf stage). 
 
Root dipping 
• 
Prepare the slurry with 5 packets (1000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 5 packets (1000g/ha) of 
Phosphobacteria or 10 packets of (2000g/ha) of Azophos inoculant in 40 litres of water and 
dip the root portion of the seedlings for 15-30 minutes in bacterial suspension and transplant.

• 
Transplant 2-3 seedlings/hill for short duration and 2 seedlings/hill for medium and long

• 
Shallow planting (3 cm) ensures quick establishment and more tillers. Deeper planting (> 
5cm) leads to delayed establishment and reduced tillers. 
• 
Line planting permits rotary weeding and its associated benefits. Allow a minimum row 
spacing of 20 cm to use rotary weeder.  
• 
Fill up the gaps between 7 and 10 DAT.  
 
Management of aged seedlings  
Follow the spacing recommended to medium and low fertility soil 
• 
Plant one or two seedlings/hill 
• 
Avoid cluster planting of aged seedlings, which are hindering the formation of new tillers. 
• 
New tillers alone are capable of producing normal harvestable panicle. Weak panicle may 
appear in the mother culm within three weeks after transplanting and vanishes well before 
harvest. 
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
"• 
To encourage the tiller production, enhance the basal N application by 50% from the 
recommended and thereafter follow the normal schedule recommended for other stages.  
 
Nutrient management  
Application of organic manures  
• 
Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost; or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha.   
• 
If green manure is raised @ 20 kg /ha, in-situ, incorporate it to a depth of 15 cm using a 
green manure trampler or tractor. 
• 
In the place of green manure, press-mud / composted coir-pith can also be used.  
 
Stubble incorporation  
• 
Apply 22 kg urea/ha at the time of first puddling while incorporating the stubbles of 
previous crop to compensate immobilization of N by the stubbles. 
• 
This may be done at least 10 days prior to planting of subsequent crop.  This 
recommendation is more suitable for double crop wetlands, wherein, the second crop is 
transplanted in succession with short turn-around period.  
 
Bio-fertilizer application  
• 
Broadcast 10 kg of soil based powdered Blue Green Algae (BGA) flakes at 10 DAT for the 
dry season crop. Maintain a thin film of water for multiplication. 
• 
Raise Azolla as a dual crop by inoculating 250 kg/ha 3 to 5 DAT and then incorporate during 
weeding for the wet season crop.   
• 
Mix 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 10 packets (2000g/ha) of Phosphobacteria 
or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos inoculants with 25 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and 
broadcast the mixture uniformly in the main field before transplanting and Pseudomonas 
fluorescens (Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the 
mixture uniformly before transplanting.  
 
Application of inorganic fertilizers 
• 
Apply fertilizer nutrients  as per soil test recommendations 
• 
If the above recommendation are not able to be followed, adopt blanket recommendation as

Split application of N and K  
• 
Apply N and K in four equal splits viz., basal, tillering, panicle initiation and heading stages. 
• 
Tillering and panicle initiation periods are crucial and should not be reduced with the 
recommended quantity.

"
"Application of P fertilizer 
• 
P may be applied as basal and incorporated. 
• 
When the green manure is applied, rock phosphate can be used as a cheap source of P 
fertilizer. If rock phosphate is applied, the succeeding rice crop need not be supplied with  P. 
Application of rock phosphate + single super phosphate or DAP mixed in different 
proportions (75:25 or 50:50) is equally effective as SSP or DAP alone. 
 
Application of Zinc sulphate  
• 
Apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate mixed with 50 kg dry sand just before transplanting. 
• 
It is enough to apply 12.5 kg zinc sulphate /ha, if green manure (6.25 t/ha) or enriched FYM, 
is applied. 
• 
If deficiency symptom appears, foliar application of 0.5% Zinc sulphate + 1.0% urea can be 
given at 15 days interval until the Zn deficiency symptoms disappear. 
 
Application of gypsum 
• 
Apply 500 kg of gypsum/ha (as source of Ca and S nutrients) at last ploughing.   
 
Foliar nutrition 
• 
Foliar spray of 1% urea + 2% DAP + 1% KCl at PI and 10 days later for all varieties. 
 
Neem treated urea  
• 
Blend the urea with crushed neem seed or neem cake 20% by weight. Powder neem cake to 
pass through 2mm sieve before mixing with urea. Keep it overnight before use (or) urea can 
be mixed with gypsum in 1:3 ratios, or urea can be mixed with gypsum and neem cake at 
5:4:1 ratio to increase the nitrogen use efficiency.   
 
Coal-tar treated urea  
• For treating 100 kg urea, one kg coal-tar and 1.5 litres of kerosene is required. Melt coal-tar 
over a low flame and dissolve it in kerosene. Mix urea with the solution thoroughly in a 
plastic container, using a stick.  Allow it to dry in shade on a polythene sheet. This can be 
stored for a month and applied basally.  
 
Weed management 
• 
Manual weeding is also essential to remove the weeds closer to rice root zone.  
• 
Cultural practices like dual cropping of rice-Azolla, reduces the weed infestation to a greater 
extent. 
• 
Summer ploughing and cultivation of irrigated dry crops during post-rainy periods reduces 
the weed infestation. 
 
Pre-emergence herbicides 
• 
Use Butachlor 1.25kg/ha or Anilophos 0.4kg/ha as pre-emergence application. Alternatively, 
pre-emergence application of herbicide mixture viz., Butachlor 0.6kg + 2,4 DEE 
0.75kg/ha,  or Anilophos + 2, 4 DEE ‘ready-mix’ at 0.4kg/ha followed by one hand weeding 
on 30-35 DAT will have a broad spectrum of weed control.  
• 
Any herbicide has to be mixed with 50kg of dry sand on the day of application (3-4 DAT) 
and applied uniformly to the field with thin film water on the 3 DAT. Water should not be 
drained for next 2 days from the field (or) fresh irrigation should not be given.

"
"• 
If pre-emergence herbicide application is not done, hand weeding has to be done on 15th 
DAT.  
• 
2,4-D sodium salt (Fernoxone 80% WP) 1.25 kg/ha dissolved in 625 litres with a high 
volume sprayer, three weeks after transplanting or when the weeds are in 3-4 leaf stage.  
 
Water management  
• 
Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement 
• 
Maintain 2.5cm of water over the puddle and allow the green manure to decompose for a 
minimum of 7 days in the case of less fibrous plants like sunnhemp and 15 days for more 
fibrous green manure plants like Kolinchi (Tephrosia purpurea).  
• 
At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2cm of water is adequate since high depth of 
water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering.  
• 
Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting.  
• 
About 5cm submergence has to be continued throughout the crop period.  
• 
Moisture stress due to inadequate water at rooting and tillering stage causes poor root 
growth leading to reduction in tillering, poor stand and low yield.  
• 
Critical stages of water requirement in rice are, a) panicle initiation, b) booting, c) heading 
and d) flowering. During these stages, the irrigation interval should not exceed the stipulated 
time so as to cause the depletion of moisture below the saturation level.  
• 
During booting and maturity stages, continuous inundation of 5cm and above leads to 
advancement in root decay and leaf senescence, delay in heading and reduction in the 
number of filled grains/panicle and poor harvest index.  
• 
Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain excess water or strictly follow irrigation 
schedule of one day after disappearance of ponded water.  Last irrigation may be 15 days 
ahead of harvest.  
 
Harvesting                                                
• 
Taking the average duration of the crop as an indication, drain the water from the field 7 to 
10 days before the expected harvest date as draining hastens maturity and improves 
harvesting conditions.  
• 
When 80% of the panicles turn straw colour, the crop is ready for harvest.  Even at this 
stage, the leaves of some of the varieties may remain green.  
• 
Confirm maturity by selecting the most mature tiller and dehusk a few grains. If the rice is 
clear and firm, it is in hard dough stage.  
• 
When most of the grains at the base of the panicle in the selected tiller are in a hard dough 
stage, the crop is ready for harvest. At this stage harvest the crop, thresh and winnow the 
grains.  
• 
Dry the grains to 12% moisture level for storage. Grain yield in rice is estimated only at 
14% moisture for any comparison. 
• 
Maturity may be hastened by 3-4 days by spraying 20% NaCl a week before harvest to 
escape monsoon rains. 
Yield: 
• Grain yield varies between 4000 and 6000 kg/ha depending on the management and climatic 
conditions. Straw yield of 8000-10000 kg/ha can normally be obtained.

II. WET SEEDED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE 
Area 
• 
Direct wet seeding can be followed in all the areas wherein transplanting is in vogue. 
 
Season: As that of transplanted rice 
 
Field preparation 
• 
On receipt of showers during the months of May-July, repeated ploughing should be carried 
out so as to conserve the moisture, destroy the weeds and break the clods. 
• 
After inundation of water, puddling is to be done as like transplanting rice. More care should 
be taken to level the field to table top level. 
• 
Stagnation of water in patches during germination and early establishment of the crop leads 
to uneven crop stand. 
• 
Land leveling has say over efficient weed and water management practices. 
•

• 
Pre-germinate the seeds as like wet nursery 
• 
Seed treatments as adopted for transplanted rice 
• 
Sow the seeds by drum seeder or broadcast uniformly with thin film of water. 
• 
Dual cropping of rice-green manure is economic for nutrient budget and efficient for grain 
production. For this method use ‘TNAU Rice-Green manure seeder’. 
 
After cultivation  
• 
Thinning and gap filling should be done 14-21 days after sowing. 
• 
If dual cropped with green manure, incorporate the green manure when grown to 40cm 
height or at 30 days after sowing, whichever is earlier, using Cono-weeder. 
• 
Green manure incorporated fields to be operated again with rotary weeder a week later in 
order to aerate the soil and to exploit organic acids formed if any. 
 
Manures and fertilizer application 
• 
For direct wet seeded lowland rice, the recommendation is same at that of transplanted rice.  
• 
Apply N and K as 25% each at 21 DAS, at active tillering, PI and heading stages.

III. DRY SEEDED RAINFED UN-PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE (Rainfed rice) 
 
The crop establishment, growth and maturity depend up on the rainfall received. There will 
be standing water after crop establishment for a minimum period of few days to a maximum up to 
grain filling, depending up on the rainfall. This type of cultivation in Tamil Nadu is called as 
‘rainfed rice’, with the assumption that the soil moisture will be under unsaturated (dry) condition 
during establishment or entire growth period, with reference to tropical climate.   
 
Area 
• 
Coastal districts of Tamil Nadu like Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, 
Virudhunagar, Sivagangai and Kanyakumari.  
 
Season 
• 
June-July (Coastal northern districts) 
• 
September-October (Coastal southern districts) 
 
Field preparation  
• 
Dry plough to get fine tilth taking advantage of rains and soil moisture availability.  
• 
Apply Gypsum @ 1 t/ha basally wherever soil crusting and soil hardening problem exist.  
• 
Perfect land leveling for efficient weed and water management. 
• 
Provide shallow trenches (15 cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field to facilitate 
draining excess water at the early growth stage. 
 
Varieties 
• 
Short duration varieties as mentioned in season and varieties including local land races 
suitable for those tracts. 
 
Sowing 
• 
Seed rate: 75kg/ha dry seed for any recommended variety. 
• 
Seed hardening with 1% KCl for 16 hours (seed and KCl solution 1:1) and shade dried to 
bring to storable moisture. This will enable the crop to withstand early moisture stress. 
• 
On the day of sowing, treat the hardened seeds first with Pseudomonas fluorescens 10g/kg 
of seed and then with Azophos 2000g or Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria @ 600g each 
per ha seed, whichever is available.  
• 
Drill sow with 20 cm inter row spacing using seed drill.  
• 
The seeds can also be sown behind the country plough.

"• 
Depth of sowing should be 3-5 cm and the top soil can be made compact with leveling 
board.  
• 
Pre-monsoon sowing is advocated for uniform germination.  
 
After cultivation  
• 
Azospirillum inoculants 10 packets (2000g/ha) and Phosphobacteria 10 packets (2000g/ha) 
or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos mixed with 25 kg of FYM may be broadcasted 
uniformly over the field just after the receipt soaking rain / moisture.  
• 
Thinning and gap filling should be done 14-21days after sowing, taking advantage of the 
immediate rain 
• 
Spray Cycocel 1000 ppm (1 ml of commercial product in one lit. of water) under water 
deficit situations to mitigate ill-effects.  
• 
Foliar spray of Kaolin 3% or KCl 1% to overcome moisture stress at different physiological 
stages of rice.  
 
Manures and fertilizer application 
• 
Blanket recommendation : 50:25:25 kg NPK/ha 
• 
Apply a basal dose of 750 kg of FYM enriched with fertilizer phosphorus (P at 25 kg/ha) 
• 
Apply N and K in two equal splits at 20-25 and 40-45 days after germination. 
• 
If the moisture availability from the tillering phase is substantial, three splits (25 kg N and 
12.5 kg K at 20-25, 40-45 and 60-65 DAS) can be adopted. 
• 
N at PI may be enhanced to 40 kg, if the tiller production is high (may be when the 
estimated LAI is greater than 5.0) and moisture availability ensured by standing water for 10 
days.  
• 
Basal application of FeSO4 at 50 kg/ha is desirable for iron deficient soil. 
• 
Foliar spray of 1% urea + 2% DAP + 1%KCl at PI and 10 days later may be taken up for 
enhancing the rice yield if sufficient soil moisture is ensured    
 
Weed management 
• 
First weeding can be done between 15 and 21 days after germination. 
• 
Second weeding may be done 30-45 days after first weeding.  
• 
Apply Pendimethalin 1.0kg/ha on 5 days after sowing or Pretilachlor + safener (Sofit) 
0.45kg/ha on the day of receipt of soaking rain followed by one hand weeding on 30 to 35 
days after sowing. 
 
Harvesting: Same as that for wet rice cultivation 
 
Yield: Grain yield levels vary widely depends on the moisture availability. Normally 50-75% of the 
normal can be obtained.  
 
DRY SEEDED RAINFED UN-PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE WITH SUPPLEMENTAL 
IRRIGATION 
 
It is called as semi-dry rice. Crop establishment is as that of rainfed rice but the rain water 
collected in village tank (Kanmai) is supplemented to protect the crop during peak vegetative and 
reproductive phases. Interaction between applied nutrients and crop is positive here due to better 
moisture availability than rainfed rice and hence, varieties may be improved ones and nutrient levels 
may be higher than the previous system.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED RICE 
 
This types of rice that have been genetically modified for agricultural purposes. The rice 
genome is usually modified using particle bombardment via the use of a gene gun or more 
commonly, a process known as agro-bacterium mediated transformation. Rice plants can be 
modified in DNA to be herbicide resistant, resist pests, increase grain size, generate nutrients, 
flavours or even produce human proteins. The natural movement of genes across species, often 
called horizontal gene transfer or lateral gene transfer, can also occur with rice through gene 
transfer mediated by natural vectors. The cultivation and use of genetically modified varieties of 
rice is however controversial and not legal in some countries. 
 
Herbicide resistant varieties 
 
Some companies introduce herbicide resistance in the non-target crop so as to make their 
herbicides more effective on their targets. Most traditional herbicides work on dicotyledons and do 
not work on grasses. The incorporation of herbicide resistance in cereal crops allows the use of 
broad-spectrum herbicides that work on all undesirable plants including monocotyledonous weeds. 
Monsanto conducts research on rice that can tolerate glyphosate (active ingredient in the herbicide 
with trade name of ""Roundup"") to produce ""Roundup Ready rice"". Bayer’s line of herbicide 
resistant rice is known as Liberty Link. Bayer crop science is currently attempting to get their latest 
variety (LL62) approved for use in the EU.  
 
Nutritional value (Golden rice) 
 
Half of the world population's main food source is rice. In Asia, white rice is eaten three 
times a day. The main concern about white rice is that it has insufficient concentrations of vitamin 
A. It has been suggested that rice could be fortified to reduce the level of nutritional vitamin A 
deficiencies. Golden rice was originally created by Dr. Ingo Potrykus and his team in Zurich, 
Switzerland. This genetically modified rice is capable of producing beta-carotene in the endosperm 
(grain) which is a pre cursor for vitamin A production. In addition, Golden rice had increased iron 
content. Potrykus’s goal is to distribute the rice to poor countries whose citizens suffer blindness 
and even death from a lack of vitamin A. Currently, the company SynGenta owns the license for 
commercial distribution of golden rice.  
 
Pest resistance 
 
BT rice is modified to express the cryIA(b) gene of the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium. 
The gene confers resistance to a variety of pests including the rice borer through the production of 
endotoxins. The Chinese Government is currently doing trials on insect resistant cultivars. The 
benefit of this is that the farmers did not need to spray their crops to control fungal, viral, or 
bacterial pathogens. In comparison, conventional rice is sprayed three to four times per growing 
season to control pesticides.

03. MAIZE - ORIGIN, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE, 
SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT, VARIETIES, CULTURAL PRACTICES 
AND YIELD 
 
VERNACULAR NAMES 
 
Bhutta (Bengali), Makai (Gujarati), Maka (Hindi, Marathi, Oriya), Musikinu jola (Kannada), 
Makaay (Kashmiri), Cholam (Malayalam), Makka Cholam (Tamil), Mokka jonnalu (Telugu) 
 
ORIGIN 
 
The primary centre of origin of maize is considered by most authorities to be the Central 
America and Mexico, where many diverse types of maize are found. The discovery of fossil maize 
pollen with other archaeological evidence in Mexico indicates Mexico to be the native of maize.  
 
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION  
 
Maize is cultivated throughout the world. From 58°N latitude to 40°S latitude, the crop 
spreads and cultivated over 139 million ha of area and around 600 million tonnes of maize is 
produced. Crop occupies the third position next to rice and wheat in area and production. USA, 
China, Brazil, Mexico, India, Romania, Philippines, Indonesia are some of important countries 
cultivate maize crop. In India, Rajasthan, UP, MP, Bihar, Karnataka, Gujarat, AP, J&K, HP and 
Maharashtra are important states produce maize.  
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
 
It is staple human food, feed for livestock, for fermentation and many industrial uses. It is 
having abundant starch (65%). There are two types of milling. Wet milling produces industrial 
starch like sweeteners, also produces various modified maize starch for paper lamination, textile 
wrap, sizing and laundry finishing. Dry milled products are animal feed, brewing, breakfast cereals, 
other food. In India, dry milling is the predominant process for flour and animal feed, fermentation 
and distilling industries and composite flours. In the new millennium, it is an alternate crop to rice 
and wheat. About 35% production is consumed by human, 25% poultry and cattle feed, 15% food 
processing.  
 
MAIZE GRAIN TYPES 
Flint corn (Zea mays indurata) 
 
Entire outer portion of kernel is hard starch. Flint comes in many colours such as white, 
yellow, red-blue or their variable. 
 
Dent corn (Zea mays indentata) 
 
About 95% of production in USA is dent corn. Hard starch is confined to kernel only. The 
amylose of soft starch in the core contracts when the grain is dried producing characteristic dent in 
the top of the kernel. May be yellow, white and red colour of kernel.  
 
Sweet corn (Zea mays saccharata) 
 
Grown for food and harvested at 70% moisture content. It is good source of energy. About 
20% of dry matter is sugar compared to 3% in dent corn. It is also a good source of vitamin C & A. 
 
Flour corn (Zea mays amylacea) 
 
Kernel is largely composed of soft starch with little or no hard starch. Kernels are easy to 
grind. Primarily used by natives of Andean Highlands of South America. 
Field Crop (Kharif)
www.AgriMoon.Com
29
"
" 
	  
Pop corn (Zea mays everta) 
 
It’s kernel is small and extreme form of flint corn. When heated to 170°C, the grain swells 
and burst and turning inside out. At this temperature, the water held in the starch turns to steam and 
the pressure causes the explosion 
 
Waxy corn (Zea mays ceretina) 
 
Due to waxy appearance of the kernel, it is called as waxy corn. The starch is entirely 
amylopectin whereas dent has 78% and 22% amylose. Hybrids of waxy are raw materials for wet 
milling starch industry for textile and paper sizing and corn oil. 
 
SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT  
Soil requirement 
 
Deep, fertile, rich in organic matter and well drained soils are the most preferred ones for the 
crop; however, maize can be grown on a variety of soil types. The soil should be medium textured 
with good water holding capacity. The crop is very sensitive to water logging and since it is mainly 
grown during rainy season, care should be taken to assure that water does not stagnate on the soil 
surface for more than 4-5 hours. Loamy or silty loam soil or silty clay loam soil having fairly 
permeable sub soil is ideal soil types. Thus, the ideal soil is neither clayey or sandy and has a pH 
between  6.5 and 7.5 along with an exchangeable capacity of around 20 milli-equivalent/100g, base 
saturation of 70-90%, bulk density of about 1.3 g/cc and water-holding capacity of about 16cm/m 
depth. 
 
Climatic requirement 
 
Maize requires 9 to 30°C from planting to emergence. Emergence to silking, leaf number 
increases with temperature and photoperiod. Increase in time to tassel as the diurnal variation 
increase from 0-17°C. Maximum rate of maize growth is at 30°C. Longer the grain filling period, 
higher the grain yield provided no freezing temperature. Higher the solar radiation, higher will be 
the photosynthesis in maize.  
 
SEASON AND VARIETIES  
 
Maize is grown in three seasons, viz., Adipattam (July–August), Purattasipattam 
(September–October) and Thaipattam (January-February). The cultivars such as CO 1, COH (M) 4, 
COH (M) 5, COBC 1 (Baby corn) suit in Tamil Nadu. 
 
CULTURAL PRACTICES 
I.  IRRIGATED MAIZE  
Application of FYM or compost  
 
Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith evenly on the un-ploughed field 
along with 10 packets of Azospirillum (2000 g/ha) and incorporate in the soil.  
 
Field preparation  
 
Plough the field with disc plough once followed by cultivator ploughing twice, after 
spreading FYM or compost till a fine tilth is obtained.

" 
	  
• 
If ridges and furrows are not made, form beds of size 10 m2 or 20 m2 depending on the 
availability of water.  
• 
Use a bund former or ridge plough to economise cost of production. 
 
Application of fertilizers  
• Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendation as far as possible. If soil test 
recommendation is not available adopt a blanket recommendation of 135:62.5:50 NPK 
kg/ha. 
• Apply quarter of the dose of N; full dose of P2O5 and K2O basally before sowing. 
• In the case of ridge planted crop, open a furrow 6 cm deep on the side of the ridge, at two 
thirds the distance from the top of the ridge.  
• Apply the fertilizer mixture along the furrows evenly and cover to a depth of 4 cm with soil. 
• If bed system of planting is followed, open furrows 6 cm deep at a distance of 60 cm apart.  
• Place the fertilizer mixture along the furrows evenly and cover to a depth of 4 cm with soil.  
• When Azospirillum is used as seed and soil application, apply 100 kg of N/ha (25% 
reduction on the total N recommended by soil test).  
 
Application of micronutrient  
• 12.5 kg of micronutrient mixture formulated by the Department of Agriculture, Tamil Nadu, 
mixed with sand to make a total quantity of 50 kg/ha is to be applied.  
• Apply the mixture over the furrows and two thirds in the top of ridges, if ridge planting is 
followed.  
• If bed system of sowing is followed, apply the micronutrient mixture over the furrows.  
• Do not incorporate the micronutrient mixture in the soil.  
 
Seed rate  
 
Select good quality seeds and adopt the seed rate of 20 kg/ha for grain maize and 25 kg /ha 
for baby corn.  
 
Spacing: Adopt a spacing of 25 cm between plants in the rows which are 60 cm apart.  
 
Seed treatment 
• Use pelleted seeds with insecticides (treat one kg of seeds with Chlorpyriphos 20EC or 
Monocrotophos 36 WSC or Phosalone 35 EC @ 4 ml + 0.5 gram gum in 20 ml of water) for 
the control of stem borer or seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WSC 10 g/kg of seeds. 
• Seed treatment with Metalaxyl or Thiram @ 2 g/kg of seed for the control of downy mildew 
and crazy top.  
• Seeds treated with fungicides may be treated with three packets (600 g/ha) of Azospirillum 
before sowing. 
 
Sowing 
• Dibble the seeds at a depth of 4 cm along the furrow in which fertilizers are placed and 
cover with soil.  
• Put one seed per hole if the germination is assured otherwise put two seeds per hole.

• Apply the pre-emergence herbicide, Atrazine 50 WP @ 500 g/ha (900 lit of water) at 3 days 
after sowing as spray on the soil surface followed by one hand weeding on 40-45 days after 
sowing.  
• Apply herbicide when there is sufficient moisture in the soil.  
• Do not disturb the soil after herbicide application.  
• Hoe and hand weed on the 17th or 18th day of sowing, if herbicide is not applied.  
NOTE: If pulse crop is to be raised as intercrop, do not use Atrazine.  
  
Thinning and gap filling 
• If two seeds were sown, leave only one healthy and vigorous seedling per hole and remove 
the other on the 12-15 days after sowing.  
• Where seedlings have not germinated, dibble pre-soaked seeds at the rate of 2 seeds per hole 
and immediately irrigate.  
 
Hoeing, hand-weeding and earthing-up 
• Hoe and hand-weed on the 30th day of sowing.  
• Earth up and form new ridges so that the plants come directly on the top of the ridges. This 
will provide additional anchorage to the plants.  
 
Top dressing with N 
• Place half of the dose of N on the 25th day of sowing along the furrows evenly  
   and cover it with soil.  
• Place the remaining quarter of N on the 45th day of sowing.  
 
Water management 
 
Maize crop is sensitive to both moisture stress and excessive moisture, hence regulate 
irrigation according to the requirement. Ensure optimum moisture availability during the most 
critical phase (45 to 65 days after sowing); otherwise yield will be reduced by a considerable extent. 
Regulate irrigation according to the following growth phase of the crop. Critical stages are, 6th leaf, 
late knee high, tasselling, 50% silking and dough stages. Of which, tasseling and silking are most 
criticalstages and water stress during these stages reduces the maize yields considerably. About 
600-700 mm is needed for 100 days crop. 
 
Harvesting 
Stage of harvest: Observe the following symptoms, taking into consideration the average duration 
of the crop. The sheath covering the cob will turn yellow and dry at maturity. The seeds become 
fairly hard and dry.  At this stage the crop is ready for harvest.  
 
Harvesting: Tear-off the cob sheath by using the gunny needle and remove the cobs from the plant.  
Carry out harvest operations at a single stage for easy transportation.  
 
Threshing cobs: Dry the cobs under the sun till the grains are dry. Use mechanical threshers or by 
running the tractor over dried cobs to separate the grains from the shank. Clean the seeds by 
winnowing. Collect and store the dry grains in gunnies.  
 
Stalk for cattle feed: Maize straw can also be used as a good cattle feed when it is green. Harvest 
the crop and cut the green straw into bits with a chaff cutter or chopping knife and feed the cattle.

Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith evenly on the unploughed field 
along with 10 packets of Azospirillum (2000 g/ha) and incorporate in the soil.  
 
Apply 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith besides chiselling, to get an 
additional yield of about 30% over control. 
Application of fertilizer  
• 
Apply NPK as per soil test recommendation as far as possible. If soil test recommendation is 
not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 60:30:30 NPK kg/ha for Alfisols and 
40:20:0 NPK kg/ha for Vertisols.  
• 
Apply half of N and full dose of P2O5 and K2O with enriched FYM as basal along with 
Azospirillum (10 packets/ha).  
• 
Top dress remaining half of N at tasseling. 
 
Seed rate: Select good quality seeds. Adopt the seed rate @ 20 kg/ha for hybrids and 25 kg/ha for 
varieties. 
 
Spacing: Adopt a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants in the row. 
 
Pre-treatment of seeds with bio-fertilizer  
 
Seeds treated with fungicides may be treated with three packets (600 g/ha) of Azospirillum.  
 
Sowing: Dibble or drill the seeds at a depth of 4 cm.

"04. WHEAT AND BARLEY - ORIGIN, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, ECONOMIC 
IMPORTANCE, SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT, VARIETIES, CULTURAL 
PRACTICES AND YIELD 
 
WHEAT (Triticum aestivum) 
VERNACULAR NAMES 
 
Gom (Bengali), Ghau (Gujarati), Gehun (Hindi), Godhi (Kannada), Ku’nu’kh (Kashmiri), 
Gothmbu (Malayalam), Gahu (Marathi), Gahama (Oriya), Kamak (Punjabi), Godumai (Tamil), 
Godhumalu (Telugu). 
 
ORIGIN 
De Candolle believed that Valley of Euphrates and Tigris was the origin of wheat. But Vavilov 
stated origin of Durum wheat is probably Abyssinia and soft wheat groups are in the region of 
Western Pakistan, South west Afghanistan, and Southern parts of mountainous Babshara. 
 
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION 
Wheat is widely cultivated cereal, spread from 57ºN to 47ºS latitude. Hence, wheat is 
cultivated and harvested throughout the year in one country or other. China, India, Russian 
federation, USA, France, Canada, Germany, Pakistan, Australia and Turkey are most important 
wheat growing countries. In India, UP, Punjab, Haryana, MP, Rajasthan, Bihar, Gujarat, 
Maharashtra, Uttaranchal and West Bengal are the important wheat cultivating states.  
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
 
Wheat is the world’s number one cereal in area. Cultivation of wheat is as old as 
civilization. It is the first mentioned crop in Bible. Wheat is eaten in various forms by more than 
1000 million people in the world. In India, it is second important staple food crop next to rice. In 
areas wheat is staple cereal food; it is eaten in the form of ‘chapattis’. In areas where rice is the 
staple cereal food, wheat is eaten in the form of ‘puris’ or in the form of ‘upma’ (cooked from ‘suji’ 
or ‘rawa’). In addition to this, wheat is also consumed in various other preparations such as ‘dalia’, 
‘halwa’, ‘sweet meals’, etc. In most of the urban areas of the country, the use of backed leavened 
bread, flakes, cakes, biscuits, etc. is increasing at a fast rate. Besides staple food to human, wheat 
straw is a good source of feed for a large population of cattle in the country. 
 
SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT 
Soil 
Wheat is cultivated in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good 
structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken 
to avoid very porous and excessively drained soils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy 
soils with good drainage are suitable for wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb 
and retain in rain water well. Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as 
wheat is sensible to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their 
water and nutrient holding capacities are improved. 
 
Climate 
Wheat has hardening ability after germination. It can germinate at temperature just above 
4ºC. After germination it can withstand freezing temperatures by as low as -9.4ºC (Spring wheat) 
and as low as -31.6ºC (Winter wheat). Normal process starts above 5ºC under the presence of 
adequate sunlight. Wheat can be exposed to low temperature during vegetative and high 
temperature and long days during reproductive phases. Optimum temperature is 20-22ºC. Optimum

"
"temperature for vegetative stage is 16-22ºC. Temperature above 22ºC decreases the plant height, 
root length and tiller number. Heading is accelerated as temperature rose from 22 to 34ºC, but, 
retarded above 34ºC. At grain development stage, temperature of 25ºC for 4-5 weeks is optimum 
and above 25ºC reduces the grain weight.  
 
It is long day plant. Long day hastens the flowering and short day increase the vegetative 
period. But, after the release of photo-insensitive varieties, no issues of photo-sensitiveness.. 
 
SPECIES OF WHEAT 
There are 7 in the world, only 4 is important in India, they are: 
1. Common wheat (T. vulgare / aestivum) 
It is also called as Bread wheat. Most suited for chapati and bakery. It is cultivated 
throughout India. Common wheat may be sub-divided in to,  
• Hard red winter wheat – commercial class 
• Hard red spring – where winter is too severe, high protein and excellent bread making 
characteristics 
• Soft red winter – grown in humid conditions, grains are soft, low protein, flour more suitable 
for cakes, cookies  
• White wheat – mainly for pasty purpose 
 
2. Duram wheat (T. durum) 
Also called as Macroni wheat. It is best suited for preparation of noodles, vermicelli, etc. 
Has spring habit and cultivated in Central & Southern India. 
 
3. Emmer wheat (T. dicoccum) 
Otherwise called as Winter / spring wheat. Wheat suitable for cultivation in Tamil Nadu, 
Gujarat, Maharashtra, AP. Preferred for granular preparation. 
 
4. Short wheat (T sphaerococcum) 
Commonly known as Indian dwarf wheat. Practically, gone out-off cultivation due to low 
productivity. Small extent North India and West Pakistan for local consumption. 
 
WHEAT VARIETAL DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIA 
Wheat selection programme was carried out in PUSA, Bihar. They released T. aestivam 
cultivars. Durum and Emmer wheat varieties were released before independence. Wheat 
Improvement Programme done by Dr. B.P. Pillai in IARI, New Delhi. Introduction of semi-dwarf 
wheat varieties was made in 1963 from Mexico. Most important varieties released are Sonora 64 & 
Lerma Rojo which has non-lodging, higher yield and Fertilizer response. Increase in wheat 
production during 63-67 was called as “Green revolution”. 
 
Further genetic advancement in these led to Kalyansona, Sonalika, UP 301 which increased 
area and productivity. Currently, Sonak was released to replace Sonalika and HD 2285, PBW 343, 
HD 2687, WH 542, UP 2336, Raj 3077, CPAN 3004, PDW 215 etc. are released for cultivation.  
 
CULTIVATION PRACTICES 
Suitable districts in Tamil Nadu: Plains & adjoining areas near to hills and hills in Theni,

24 hours before sowing. 
 
Forming beds and channel: Form beds with size of 10 m2 or 20 m2. The irrigation channels are to 
be provided sufficiently. 
 
Application of fertilizers 
• Apply NPK fertilizer as per soil test recommendation as far as possible. If soil test 
recommendation is not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 80:40:40 NPK kg/ha. 
• Apply half of N and full dose of P2O5 and K2O basally before sowing and incorporate in the 
sowing. 
 
Sowing: Draw the lines in 20 cm apart and sow the seeds continuously after application of 
fertilizers to a depth of 5 cm. Avoid deep sowing. 
 
Weed management 
• Apply Isoproturon @ 800 g/ha as pre-emergence spraying 3 days after sowing followed by 
one hand weeding on 35th day after sowing. 
• If herbicide is not applied, give two hand weedings on 20th and 35th day after sowing. 
 
 Water management 
The crop requires 4-6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall. Wheat crop 
requires minimum of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages such as, immediately after sowing, 
crown root initiation (15-20 DAS), active tillering stage (35-40 DAS), flowering stage (50-55 DAS) 
and grain filling stage (70-75 DAS). Crown root initiation and flowering are the most critical stages. 
Water stagnation should be avoided at the time of germination. 
 
Top dressing: Apply remaining half of N at crown root initiation stage (15-20 DAS). 
 
Harvesting: Harvest the crop when the grains become hard and straw becomes dry and brittle. 
Trash and winnow the grains. Use mechanical threshers to reduce the cost of threshing and 
winnowing.

BARLEY (Hordeum vulgare)  
ORIGIN 
Near-East region as probable place of origin for Barley. Abyssinia is believed as centre of 
origin for barley by one group and south East Asia (China, Tibet, Nepal) by another group. 
 
GEOGRAPHYCAL DISTRIBUTION 
Barley is cultivated all most similar to wheat crop. In the world, Europe is the most 
predominant continent growing Barley followed by Asia. The countries such as, Russian 
federation, China, Canada, USA, Spain, France, Australia, UK and India cultivate barley. In India, 
UP, Rajasthan, MP, Haryana, Punjab and HP are the major states cultivating barley.  
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
It is important next to rice, wheat, maize in area and production. It is more suitable than 
wheat in India. Due to hardy nature, it can withstand adverse agro-environments like, drought, 
salinity, alkalinity, varied topography like plain, hill, under rainfed and irrigated conditions, etc. It is 
the crop preferred by farmers where wheat is not possible. 
 
It is a Rabi cereal crop and food for people of cooler and semi-arid part of the world. In 
India, 90% of barley is used as human food. Used for preparation of malt, beer, whisky and 
industrial alcohol, vinegar. Energy rich drinks like bournvita, boost, horlicks and biscuit are from 
barley malt. Medicinal value of barley reduces cholesterol level in liver and also stimulates fatty 
acid synthesis in liver. In USA as cattle feed and horse feed. Barley has great demand to malting 
industry. Good quality grain production may open foreign exchanges. Protein - 11.5%, carbohydrate 
- 74%, fat - 1.3%, crude fibre - 3.9%, ash - 1.5%. 
 
SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT 
Soil requirement 
Barley is tolerant to salinity and alkalinity, but, sensitive to acidity. Barley, being salt 
tolerant, best substitute for sodic soil. Drained, fertile deep loam soil with pH 7-8. Barley grown in 
high N soils, often lodges. 
 
Climatic requirement 
Climate necessary for successful barley cultivation is similar to wheat. It performs well in 
cool climate. Warm and moist conditions are not conducive for barley growth. It can’t tolerate to 
frost and frost and hail storm at flowering are more detrimental. 
 
Season: Under rainfed sow barley before end of October. In irrigated condition, first or second 
fortnight of November is optimum time of sowing. In Hilly zones barley is sown as summer crop in 
April-May months. 
 
Seed rate: Irrigated condition – 100 kg/ha; Rainfed – 80-100 kg/ha 
 
Spacing: 22.5cm row spacing for irrigated and 22.5 to 25 for rainfed situation is optimum for better 
yields. Depth of sowing must be 5cm under irrigated situation, whereas, in rainfed condition it is 6-
8cm.

06. SORGHUM AND PEARL MILLET - ORIGIN, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE, SOIL AND CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT, VARIETIES, 
CULTURAL PRACTICES AND YIELD  
 
SORGHUM (Sorghum bicolor L.) 
VERNACULAR NAMES 
 
Juar (Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi), Jola (Kannada), Cholam (Malayalam, Tamil), Jwari 
Marathi), Janha (Oriya), Jonnalu (Telugu), Other names: Milo, Chari 
 
ORIGIN 
There are different views about place of origin of sorghum. Warth (1937) was of the opinion 
that it was originated in India and Africa. De Candolle said that sorghum was originated in Africa. 
It is believed to originate from North East of Africa or Abyssinia and brought to USA and 
European countries by slaves.  
	  
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION 
 
Sorghum is grown all parts of the world except cool North east part of Europe. Sorghum 
belts in India receive 400-1000mm rainfall. In the World, Africa (Nigeria, Sudan) is the major 
continent cultivates sorghum and North America, South America and Asian continents also grow 
sorghum. In India, mainly on central & peninsular India such as, Maharashtra, Karnataka, MP, AP, 
Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat are important states cultivating sorghum crop.  
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
 
Sorghum is a cereal grain crop mostly grown in Africa, Asia and Central America, primarily 
to ease food insecurity. It is the world's fifth largest grain crop and Africa's second most important 
in terms of tonnage. Sorghum is mostly grown in semi-arid or sub-tropical regions due to its 
resistance to harsh weather conditions. 
 
 
 
Sorghum, a grain, forage or sugar crop is among the most efficient crops in conversion of 
solar energy and use of water. Sorghum is known as a high-energy, drought tolerant crop. Because 
of its wide uses and adaptation “sorghum is one of the really indispensable crops” required for the 
survival of humankind. 
 
 
 
In the United States, South America, and Australia sorghum grain is used primarily for 
livestock feed and in a growing number of ethanol plants. In the livestock market, sorghum is used 
in the poultry, beef and pork industries. Stems and foliage are used for green chop, hay, silage, and 
pasture.  
 
CULTURAL PRACTICES 
SEASON AND VARIETIES  
• Thaipattam (January-February), Chithiraipattam (April-May), Adipattam (June-July) and 
Puratasipattam (September-October) are the four common seasons for sorghum crop in 
Tamil Nadu.  
• The cultivars, CO 26, CO (S) 28, CO (S) 30, BSR 1, COH 4, K tall, K 11, Paiyur 1, Paiyur 2 
and APK 1 are most commonly used in Tamil Nadu. 
 
Selection of seeds: Good quality seeds are collected from disease and pest-free fields.  
 
Seed rate: Irrigated: Transplanted - 7.5 kg/ha; Direct sown - 10 kg/ha  
                   Rainfed (Direct sown)   - 15 kg/ha

Sorghum under irrigated condition is raised both as a direct sown and transplanted crop.  
Advantages of transplanted crop:  
• Main field duration is reduced by 10 days.  
• Shoot fly, which attacks direct sown crops during the first 3 weeks and which is difficult to 
control, can be controlled effectively and economically in the nursery itself.  
• Seedlings which show chlorotic and downy mildew symptoms can be eliminated, thereby 
incidence of downy mildew in the main field can be minimised. 
• Optimum population can be maintained as only healthy seedlings are used for transplanting.  
• Seed rate can also be reduced by 2.5 kg/ha.  
 
NURSERY PRACTICES FOR TRANSPLANTED SORGHUM 
Nursery preparation  
For raising seedlings to plant one hectare, select 7.5 cents (300 m2) near a water source 
where water will not stagnate. 
 
Application of FYM to the nursery  
• Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost and apply another 500 kg of compost or FYM for 
covering the seeds after sowing.  
• Spread the manure evenly on the un-ploughed soil and incorporate by ploughing or apply 
just before last ploughing. 
 
Laying the nursery 
• Provide three separate units of size 2 m x 1.5 m with 30 cm space in between the plots and 
all around the unit for irrigation.  
• Excavate the soil from the inter-space and all around to a depth of 15 cm to form channels 
and spread the soil removed on the bed and level. 
 
Pre-treatment of seeds  
• 
Treat the seeds 24 hours prior to sowing with Carbendazim or Captan or Thiram at 2g/kg of 
seed.  
• 
Treat the seeds with three packets (600 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 3 packets (600g) of 
phosphobacteria or 6 packets of Azophos (1200g) using rice gruel as binder. 
 
Sowing and covering the seeds 
• 
Make shallow rills, not deeper than 1cm on the bed by passing the fingers vertically over it. 
• 
Broadcast 7.5 kg of treated seeds evenly on the beds. 
• 
Cover by leveling the rills by passing the hand lightly over the soil. 
 
Water management  
• 
Provide one inlet to each nursery unit.  
• 
Allow water to enter through the inlet and cover all the channels till the raised beds are wet 
and then cut off water  
• 
Adjust the frequency of irrigation according to the soil types. If it is red soils, at 4-5 days 
interval and black soils, 5-6 days interval is to be maintained. 
 
NOTE: Do not keep the seedlings in the nursery for more than 18 days. If older seedlings are used, 
establishment and yield are adversely affected. Do not allow cracks to develop in the nursery by 
properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water.

B. MAIN FIELD PREPARATION  
Ploughing  
• 
Plough the field with an iron plough once (or) twice. Sorghum does not require fine tilth 
since fine tilth adversely affects germination and yield in the case of direct sown crop.  
• 
To overcome the subsoil hard pan in Alfisols (deep red soils) chiseling the field at 0.5m 
intervals to a depth of 40 cm on both the directions of the field followed by disc ploughing 
once and cultivator ploughing twice help to increase the yield of sorghum and the 
succeeding blackgram also. This was true with Sorghum followed by Groundnut also.  
• 
Application of FYM and 100% of recommended N can also be followed. In soils with sub-
soil hard pan, chiselling should be done every year at the start of the cropping sequence to 
create a favourable physical environment.  
 
Application of FYM  
Spread 12.5 t/ha FYM or composted coir pith along with 10 packets of Azospirillum 
(2000g/ha) and 10 packets (2000 g/ha) of phosphobacteria or 20 packets of Azophos (4000g/ha) on 
the unploughed field and incorporate the manure in the soil. Apply well decomposed poultry 
manure @ 5 t/ha to improve the grain yield as well as physical properties of soils. 
 
Formation of ridges and furrows  
• 
Form ridges and furrows using a ridger at 6 m long and 45 cm apart. 
• 
Form irrigation channels across the furrows. 
• 
Alternatively, form beds of size 10 m2 and 20 m2 depending on the availability of water.  
 
Application of fertilizers 
Transplanted crop 
• 
Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. If soil test recommendations are not 
available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 90 N, 45 P2O5, 45 K2O kg/ha. 
• 
Apply N @ 50:25:25% at basal, 15 and 30 DAS and full dose of P2O5 and K2O basally 
before planting. 
• 
In the case of ridge planted crop, open a furrow 5cm deep on the side of the ridge at two 
thirds the distance from the top of the ridge and place the fertilizer mixture along the furrow 
and cover with soil up to 2 cm.  
• 
Soil application of Azospirillum at 10 packets (2 kg/ha) and 10 packets (2000g/ha) of 
phosphobacteria or 20 packets of Azophos (4000g/ha) after mixing with 25 kg of FYM + 25 
kg of soil may be carried out before sowing/planting.  
 
Direct sown crop  
• 
As above. 
• 
In the case of sorghum raised as a mixed crop with a pulse crop (Blackgram, Greengram or 
Cowpea) open furrows 30 cm apart to a depth of 5 cm.  
• 
Apply fertilizer mixture in two lines in which sorghum is to be raised and cover upto 2 cm.  
• 
Skip the third row in which the pulse crop is to be raised and place fertilizer mixture in the 
next two rows and cover upto 2 cm with soil.  
• 
When Azospirillum is used, apply only 75% of recommended N for irrigated sorghum.  
 
Application of micronutrient mixture 
Transplanted crop  
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
" 
	  
• 
Mix 12.5 kg/ha of micronutrient mixture formulated by the Department of Agriculture, 
Tamil Nadu with enough sand to make a total quantity of 50 kg and apply the mixture over 
the furrows and on top one third of the ridges.  
• 
If micronutrient mixture is not available, mix 25 kg of zinc sulphate with sand to make a 
total quantity of 50 kg and apply on the furrows and on the top one third of the ridges.  
 
Direct sown crop  
• As above. 
• Basal application of FeSO4, 50 kg/ha along with 12.5 t/ha FYM for iron deficient soils. 
 
Sowing / Transplanting sorghum 
Transplanted crop 
•  Pull out the seedlings when the seedlings are 15 to 18 days old.  
• Prepare slurry with 5 packets of Azospirillum (1000g/ha) and 5 packets (1000g/ha) of 
Phosphobacteria or 10 packets of Azophos (2000 g/ha) in 40 lit. of water and dip the root 
portion of the seedlings in the solution for 15-30 minutes and transplant.  
• Plant one seedling per hill  
• Plant the seedlings at a depth of 3 to 5 cm.  
• Plant the seedlings on the side of the ridge, half the distance from the top of the ridge and 
the bottom.  
• Maintain a spacing of 15 cm between plants in the row which are 45 cm apart (15 
plants/m2). 
 
Direct sown crop 
• In the case of pure crop of sorghum, maintain the seed rate at 10kg/ha. 
• In the case of inter crop of sorghum with pulse crop, maintain the seed rate of sorghum at 10 
kg/ha and pulse crop at 10 kg/ha.  
• In the case of pure crop of sorghum, sow the seeds with a spacing of 15 cm between seeds in 
the rows which are 45 cm apart.  
• Maintain one plant per hill.  
• If shootfly attack is there, remove the side shots and retain one healthy shoot.  
• Sow the seeds over the lines where fertilizers are placed.  
• Sow the seeds at a depth of 2 cm and cover with soil.  
• In the case of sorghum intercropped with pulses, sow one paired row of sorghum alternated 
with a single row of pulses. The spacing between the row of sorghum and pulse crop is 30 
cm.  
• Forage cowpea CO 1 can be inter-cropped in sorghum at two rows of fodder cowpea in 
between paired rows of sorghum.  
 
Weed management  
• Apply the pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine 50 WP @500 g/ha on 3 days after sowing as 
spray on the soil surface, using Backpack / Knapsack / Rocker sprayer fitted with a flat fan 
nozzle using 900 litres of water/ha. 
• Sorghum is slow growing in early stages and is adversely affected by weed competition. 
Therefore keep the field free of weeds up to 45 days. For this, after pre-emergence herbicide 
application, one hand weeding on 30-35 days after sowing may be given. 
•  If pulse crop is to be raised as an inter-crop in sorghum do not use Atrazine. 
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
" 
	  
• Hoe and hand weed on the 10th day of transplanting if herbicides are not used. Hoe and weed 
between 30-35 days after transplanting and between 35-40 days for a direct sown crop, if 
necessary. 
 
Thinning of the seedlings and gap filling 
Thin the seedlings and gap fill with the seedlings thinned out. Maintain a spacing of 15 cm 
between plants after the first hand weeding on the 23rd day of sowing. Thin the pulse crop to a 
spacing of 10 cm between plants for all pulse crop except cowpea, for which spacing is maintained 
at 20 cm between plants.  
 
Water management 
 
Usually sorghum is raised as rainfed crop. The irrigation should, however, be provided 
whenever, rains are not received. At the time of flowering and grain filling stages, the crop requires 
more water. If enough moisture is not there in the soil at the time of flowering and grain filling 
stages, it should be irrigated at once. At no stage, the plants should be allowed to wilt. Suitable 
drainage conditions should be provided for the removal of excess rain water from the field. About 
400mm of water is required to raise grain sorghum crop.  
 
NOTE : Adjust irrigation schedule according to the weather conditions and depending upon the 
receipt of rains.  
 
Contingent plan: This should be done before 75% of soil moisture is lost from available water. 
Spraying 3% Kaolin (30 g in one litre of water) during periods of stress will mitigate the ill effects.  
 
Harvesting and processing 
• Consider the average duration of the crop and observe the crop. When the crop matures the 
leaves turn yellow and present a dried up appearance. 
• The grains are hard and firm. At this stage, harvest the crop by cutting the earheads 
separately. Cut the straw after a week, allow it to dry and then stack. In the case of tall 
varieties, cut the stem at 10 to 15 cm above ground level and afterwards separate the 
earheads and stack the straw. Dry the earheads. Thresh using a mechanical thresher or by 
drawing a stone roller over the earheads or by using cattle and dry the produce and store. 
 
RAINFED SORGHUM 
Rainfall: Average and well distributed rainfall of 250-300 mm is optimum for rainfed sorghum.  
 
Distribution 
Rainfed sorghum is cultivated in Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, 
Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar, Sivagangai, Tiruchirapalli, Erode, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and 
Dharmapuri districts of Tamil Nadu.  
 
Season 
The crop can be grown in South west and North east monsoon seasons provided, the rainfall 
is evenly distributed.  
 
Field preparation  
• As above 
• To conserve the soil moisture sow the seeds in flat beds and form furrows between crop 
rows during inter cultivation or during third week after sowing. 
 
Seed rate: 15 kg/ha

Seed treatment  
• Seed hardening ensures high germination. The seeds are pre-soaked in 2% potassium 
dihydrogen phosphate solution for 6 hours in equal volume and then dried back to its 
original moisture content in shade and are used for sowing.  
• Harden the seeds with 1% aqueous fresh leaf extract of Prosopis juliflora and pungam, 
(Pongamia pinnata) mixed in 1:1 for 16 hrs at 1:0.6 ratio (Seed and solution) followed by 
drying and subsequently pelleting the seeds with Pungam leaf powder @300 g/kg with 
gruel.  
• Soak the seeds in 500 ppm of CCC (500 mg in one litre of water) for six hours and shade 
dry the seeds for 5 hours. Use 350 ml of solution for soaking one kg of seed. 
• Treat the seeds with three packets of Azospirillum (600 g) and 3 packets of phosphobacteria 
or 6 packets of Azophos (1200 g/ha). In the main field, apply 10 packets of Azospirillum 
2000 g/ha and 10 packets (2000g/ha) of phosphobacteria or 20 packets of Azophos (4000 
g/ha) with phosphobacteria 2 kg with 25 kg FYM + 25 kg soil. 
 
Pre-monsoon sowing  
      Sow the hardened seeds at 5 cm depth with seed cum fertilizer drill to ensure uniform depth of 
sowing and fertilizer application before the onset of monsoon as detailed below:  
District  
Optimum period  
1. Coimbatore  
37-38th week (II to III week of September)  
2. Erode

Sowing 
Sow the seeds well before the onset of monsoon at 5 cm depth (by seed drill or by country 
plough). The seed is pelletised with 15 g of Chloropyriphos in 150 ml of gum and shade dried.  
 
• Sow the sorghum seeds over the line where the fertilizers are placed. 
• Sow the seeds at a depth of 5 cm and cover with the soil.  
• Sow the seeds with the spacings of 15 cm in the paired rows spaced 60 cm apart.  
• Sow the pulse seeds to fall 10 cm apart in the furrows between the paired rows of sorghum.  
 
Spacing: 45 x 15 cm or 45 x 10 cm.  
 
Fertilizer application 
Apply 12.5 t/ha of Composted coir pith + NPK at 40:20:0; Apply enriched FYM 750 kg/ha. 
The recommended dose of 40 kg N and 20 kg P2O5/ha for rainfed sorghum can be halved if FYM @ 
5 t/ ha is applied.  
Weed management 
Keep sorghum field free of weeds from second week after germination till 5th week. If 
sufficient moisture is available spray Atrazine @ 500 g/ha as pre-emergence application within 3 
days after the receipt of the soaking rainfall for sole sorghum while for sorghum based 
intercropping system with pulses, use Pendimethalin at 3.0 l/ha.  
 
Cropping system

"
" 
	  
• 
The most profitable and remunerative sorghum based cropping system adopted is sorghum 
with cowpea, redgram, lab-lab, blackgram.  
• 
In rainfed Vertisol, adopt paired row planting in sorghum and sow one row of blackgram/ 
cowpea in between paired rows of sorghum to have 100% population of sorghum plus 33% 
population of blackgram/cowpea.  
• 
Intercropping of sunflower CO 1, with the main crop of sorghum CO 26 in 4:2 ratio is 
recommended under rainfed conditions during North-East monsoon for black soils of 
Coimbatore.  
• 
Intercropping of soybean with sorghum in the ratio 4:2 is recommended for kharif   seasons.  
• 
Tamarind and Neem trees upto 3-4 years from date of planting form an ideal tree component 
for agroforestry in black cotton soils of Kovilpatti. Sorghum and blackgram gave higher 
yield even at 50% of the recommended level of fertilizer application 
 
RATOON SORGHUM CROP 
Ratooning technique 
• Harvest the main crop leaving 15 cm stubbles.  
• Remove the first formed two sprouts from the main crop and allow only the later formed 
two sprouts to grow.  Allow two tillers per hill.  
 
 Hoeing and weeding 
• Remove the weeds immediately after harvest of the main crop.  
• Hoe and weed twice on 15th and 30th day after cutting.  
 
Application of fertilizers  
• Apply 100 kg N/ha in two split doses.  
• Apply the first dose on 15th day after cutting and the second on 45th day after cutting. Apply 
50 kg P2O5/ha along with the application of N on 45th day. 
 
Water management  
• Irrigate immediately after cutting the main crop.  
• Irrigation should not be delayed for more than 24 hours after cutting.  
• Irrigate on 3rd or 4th day after cutting. Subsequently irrigate once in 7-10 days.  
• Stop irrigation on 70-80 days after ratooning.  
 
Harvest  
• Harvest the crop when the grains turn yellow. 
NOTE: The duration of the ratoon crop is about 15 days less than the main crop. 
 
Yield 
Grain yield of 4.0–6.0 tonnes and fodder yield of 15-20 tonnes can be obtained under 
irrigated condition. In rainfed areas, 50-60% of grain yield and 60-80% of fodder yield can be made 
possible depending on the rainfall prevailed. Under ratoon condition, mainly sorghum is raised for 
fodder purpose and about 15 tonnes of fodder yield can be obtained. 
PEARL MILLET (Pennisetum glaucum (L) R. Br.) 
 
VERNACULAR NAMES 
 
Bajra (Bengali, Hindi, Oriya), Bajri (Gujarati, Marathi), Sajje (Kannada), Bajr’u (Kashmiri), 
Cambu (Malayalam, Tamil), Sazzalu (Telugu). Other names: Spiked millet, Pearl millet  
 
ORIGIN 
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
" 
	  
 
Most of the scientists believe that the primary centre of origin of pearl millet is Africa from 
where it spread to India. In study of the variability of a large number of strains of pearl millet from 
Africa and India, the greatest range of variability was found in the strains from Africa. This is 
further evidence of the African origin of pearl millet.  
 
GEOGRAPHIC DISTIBUTION 
 
Pearl millet is a crop grown mostly in tropical climate. It is widely grown in Africa and 
Asia. The important pearl millet growing countries are India, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan, 
Egypt, Arabia and Russia. In India pearl millet is grown in almost everywhere except in high 
rainfall areas like Assam, West Bengal and Odisha. States of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP, 
Haryana accounts 87% of total area.  
 
ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE 
 
Pearl millet is one of the major coarse grain crops and is considered to be a poor man’s food. 
It is staple food in a short period in the relatively dry tracts of the country. It is the most drought 
tolerant crop among cereals and millets. The grain of pearl millet is superior in nutritive value to 
sorghum grain but inferior in feeding value. Grain contains 12.4% of moisture, 11.6% of protein, 
5% of fat, 67% of carbohydrates and 2.7% of minerals. Pearl millet grains are eaten cooked like rice 
or ‘chapatis’ are prepared. It is also used as feed for poultry industry and green fodder or dry fodder 
for cattle. 
  
CULTIVATION PRACTICES 
 Season and varieties 
Chithiraipattam (March-April) and Masipattam (January-February) are the two most 
common seasons of pearl millet. Pearl millet is cultivated throughout the state except the Nilgris. 
CO 7, CO (Cu) 9, X 7, ICMV 221 are important cultivars of pearl millet in Tamil Nadu. 
 
A. NURSERY  
Preparation of land 
• For raising seedlings to plant one ha select 7.5 cents near a water source. Water should not 
stagnate. 
• Plough the land and bring it to the fine tilth. 
Application of FYM  
Apply 750 kg of FYM or compost and incorporate by ploughing. Cover the seeds with 500 
kg of FYM.  
 
Forming raised bed 
• In each cent mark 6 plots of the size 3 m x 1.5 m with 30 cm channel in between the plots 
and all around.  
• Form the channel to a depth of 15 cm.  
• Spread the earth excavated from the channel on the beds and level.  
NOTE: The Unit of 6 plots in one cent will form one unit for irrigation.  
 
Removal of ergot affected seeds and Sclerotia to prevent primary infection 
• Dissolve one kg of common salt in 10 litres of water.    
• Drop the seeds into the salt solution  
• Remove the ergot and sclerotia affected seeds which will float.

• Wash seeds in fresh water 2 or 3 times to remove the salt on the seeds. 
• Dry the seeds in shade. 
 
Treat the seeds with three packets (600g) of the Azospirillum inoculant and 3 packets (600g) 
of phosphobacteria or 6 packets (1200g) of Azophos. 
 
Treatment of the nursery bed with insecticides 
Apply phorate 10 G 180 g or Carbofuran 3 G 600 g mixed with 2 kg of moist sand, spread 
on the beds and work into the top 2 cm of soil to protect the seedlings from shoot fly infestation.  
 
Sowing and covering the seeds 
• Open small rills not deeper than 1 cm on the bed by passing the fingers over it.  
• Sow 3.75 kg of seeds in 7.5 cents (0.5 kg /cent) and use increased seed rate up to 12.5 kg per 
ha in shootfly endemic area and transplant only healthy seedlings. 
• Cover the seeds by smoothening out the rills with hand.  Sprinkle 500 kg of FYM or 
compost evenly and cover the seeds completely with hands 
NOTE: Do not sow the seeds deep as germination will be affected.  
 
Irrigation to the seed bed 
• Provide one inlet to each unit of 6 plots to allow water in the channels. 
• Allow water to enter the channel and rise up in it. Turn off the water when the raised bed is 
wet. 
Note: The seedlings should not be kept in nursery for more than 18 days. Otherwise the 
establishment and yield will be affected adversely. Ensure that cracks should not develop in the 
nursery. This can be avoided by properly adjusting the quantity of irrigation water.  
 
B. MAIN FIELD  
Field preparation  
• Plough with an iron plough twice and with country plough twice. Bring the soil into fine 
tilth.  
• Chiseling for soils with hard pan:  Chisel the soils having hard pan formation at shallow 
depths with chisel plough at 0.5m interval, first in one direction then in the direction 
perpendicular to the previous one, once in three years. 
 
Application of FYM or compost  
Spread 12.5 t/ha of FYM or compost or composted coir pith uniformly on unploughed soil. 
incorporate the manure by working the country plough and apply Azospirillum to the soil @ 10 
packets per ha (2000 g) and 10 packets (2000g) of phosphobacteria (or) 20 packets (4000g) of 
azophos with 25kg of soil and 25 kg of FYM. 
 
Forming ridges and furrows/beds 
• Form ridges and furrows (using 3 ridges) 6 m long and 45 cm apart. If pulses is 
intercropped, form ridges and furrows 6 m long and 30 cm apart. 
• If ridge planting is not followed, form beds of the size 10 m2 or 30 m2 depending upon 
water availability. 
• Form irrigation channels. 
Field Crop (Kharif)

"
" 
	  
• To conserve soil moisture under rainfed condition, sow the seeds in flat and form furrows 
between crop rows during inter cultivation on third week after sowing.  
 
Application of fertilizers  
Apply NPK fertilizers as per soil test recommendations as far as possible. If soil test 
recommendation is not available follow the blanket recommendation of 70:35:35 kg N, P2O5, K2O/ 
ha for all varieties. For hybrids, apply 80 kg N, 40 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O/ha. Apply the 
recommended N in three splits as 25:50:25 per cent at basal, 15 and 30 DAS and full dose of 
phosphorus and potassium basally.  Combined application of Azospirillum and phosphobacteria or 
Azophos along with 75 per cent of the recommended level of N and P is recommended for rainfed 
conditions.  
 
Method of application: For transplanted crop, open a furrow more than 5 cm deep on the side of 
the ridge (1/3 distance from the bottom), place the fertilizer and cover.  For the direct sown crop, 
mark the lines more than 5 cm deep 45 cm apart in the beds. Place the fertilizer below 5 cm depth 
and cover up to 2 cm from the top before sowing. In the case of intercropping with pulses, mark 
lines more than 5 cm deep 30 cm apart in the beds. Apply fertilizer only in the rows in which pearl 
millet is to be sown and cover up to 2 cm. When Azospirillum inoculant is used for seeds, seedlings 
use only 50 kg N/ha for variety, 60 kg N/ha for hybrid, as soil application in other words, reduce 
25% N of soil test recommendations.  
 
Application of micronutrient mixture  
Apply 12.5 kg/ha of micronutrient mixture formulated by the Department of Agriculture. 
Mix the mixture with enough sand to make 50 kg and apply on the surface just before planting/after 
sowing and cover the seeds. Broadcast the mixture on the surface to seed line. If micronutrient 
mixture is not available apply 25 kg of zinc sulphate per ha. Mix the chemical with enough sand to 
make 50 kg and apply as above.  
 
 MANAGEMENT OF MAIN FIELD 
Transplanted crop 
• Pull out the seedlings when they are 15 to 18 days old.  
• Adopt the spacing 45 x 15 cm for all the varieties.  
• Plant seedlings on the side of ridge, half way from the bottom. Depth of planting should be 3 
to 5 cm.  
• Root dipping with bio-fertilizers: Prepare the slurry with 5 packets (1000 g)/ha of 
Azospirillum inoculant and 5 packets (1000g/ha) of phosphobacteria or 10 packets of 
Azophos (2000g/ha) in 40 lit. of water and dip the roots of the seedlings 15-30 minutes 
before planting.  
 
Direct sown crop  
• Soaking of pearl millet seeds either in 2% Potassium chloride (KCl) or 3% Sodium Chloride 
(NaCl) for 16 hours followed by 5 hours shade drying improves germination and stand.  
• Adopt the spacing of 45 x 15 cm for all varieties. If pulse is intercropped, adopt a spacing of 
30 x 15 cm for pearl millet and 30 x 10 cm for pulses. One pair row of pearl millet is 
alternated with a single row of pulse crop.  
• In the furrows in which fertilizers have been applied, place 5 kg of seed, allowing them to 
fall 4-5 cm apart (Use higher seed rate of 5 kg to offset mortality).  The optimum population

should be 1, 45,000 per ha. Use increased seed rate up to 12.5 kg per hectare in shoot fly 
endemic area and remove the shoot fly damaged seedlings at the time of thinning. 
• Where pulse seeds are to be sown, drop pulse seeds to fall 5 cm apart and cover.  
 
Weed management 
• Apply the pre-emergence herbicide Atrazine 50 WP @ 500 g/ha, 3 days after sowing  or 
transplanting as spray on the soil surface using Back-pack/Knapsack/Rocker sprayer fitted 
with flat type nozzle using 900 l of water/ha. 
• Apply herbicide when there is sufficient moisture in the soil.  
• Hand weed on 30 - 35 days after sowing if pre-emergence herbicide is applied. 
• If pre-emergence herbicide is not applied hand weed twice on 15 and 30 days after sowing. 
 
Thinning and gap filling 
In direct sown crop after 1st weeding at the time of irrigation, gap fill and thin the crop to a 
spacing of 15 cm between plants; cowpea crop to 20 cm between plants and other pulses crops to 10 
cm between plants.  
 
Top dressing of fertilizers 
• Top dress the nitrogen at 15 and 30 days after transplanting or direct sowing.  
• In transplanted crop, open a furrow 5 cm deep with a stick or hoe at the bottom of the 
furrow, place the fertilizer and cover.  
• In the case of direct sown crop apply the fertilizer in band.  If intercropped with pulses apply 
the fertilizer to pearl millet crop only.  
• After the application of fertilizer, irrigate the crop.  
  
Water management 
 
It is highly drought tolerant and hence, 2-3 irrigations are sufficient. Flowering and grain 
filling are the critical stages and about 300-400mm of water is sufficient to complete its life cycle.  
NOTE: Irrigation schedule is to be adjusted depending upon the prevailing weather conditions.  
 
Harvesting the crop 
Symptoms of maturity: Leaves will turn yellow and present a dried appearance. Grains will be 
hardened.  
Harvesting: Cut the earheads separately. Cut the straw after a week, allowing it to dry and stack it 
in the field till it can be transported.  
 
Threshing, cleaning, drying and storing 
Dry the earheads. Thresh in a mechanical thresher or spread it and drag a stone roller over it 
or cattle threshes. Dry the seeds below 10 per cent and mix 100 kg of grains with 1kg of activated 
kaolin to reduce the rice weevil and rice moth incidence. Spray Malathion 50EC 10 ml/ lit @ 3 lit of 
spray fluid/100 m2 over the bags during storage godowns, For grain purpose the grain should be 
dried well below 10% moisture and stored in gunny bags.

o Rainfall of 400-750mm 
o Mostly Arid & Semi-Arid regions 
o For vegetative growth moist weather & medium RF is sufficient 
o Temp are 28 to 32º C is optimum for vegetative growth 
o Higher temp at this stage induces early flowering 
o Pearlmillet does not resist drought but cut shorts  its life cycle and comes 
flowering early under adverse conditions 
o Rainfall during flowering & grain formation– poor grain setting 
o Rain at grain maturity – ergot disease due to high humidity & low temp. 
o Hence optimum time of sowing is very vital for this crop

– 20 kg sulphur as gypsum along with DAP 20kg as foliar may be given 
– Zinc application up to 20 kg  for deficient soil 
• 
Water management 
– Deep rooted system helps to draw moisture from deeper  
– Branching, flowering and pod-filling are crucial 
– Irrigation at 0.4 IW/CPE ratio 
• 
Root penetration is better at 0.4 than 0.6 
– Avoid water stagnation at any stage 
– 2 irrigations + life irrigation is sufficient 
• 
Weed management 
– Being initial sluggish growth weed is problem 
– Crop weed competition is for 7-8 weeks 
– May be managed by quick growing short duration crops as intercropping 
– Mulching in between the rows can reduce weeds 
–  Inter cultivation / hand weeding is must 
– PE application of Fluchloralin 0.75 kg or Pendimethalin 0.75kg on 3rd day 
after sowing 
• 
Cropping system 
– It is basically an intercrop with short duration crops 
• 
With cereals : Sorghum + pp; FM + pp; Maize + pp 
• 
With pulses: pp + greengram / blackgram / soybean 
• 
With other crops: pp + groundnut / castor / sesame / cotton / 
sugarcane / sunflower 
– In sequential cropping 
• 
Pp –wheat / mustard – greengram 
• 
Pp – potato – blackgram / greengram 
• 
Harvesting 
– Indeterminate growth no-synchronized maturity 
– When 70-80% pods turn brown cut & dried 
– Threshing may be passing stone roller / beating against hard surface 
– Seeds may be stored at 10-12% moisture 
– Splitting of cotyledons involves two steps 
• 
Loosening the husk from the cotyledons 
• 
And removing the husk and splitting them using rollers as dal

Green manuring & Green leaf manuring 
• Green manuring 
o Growing of crop purposely and incorporating it in the soil for manuring 
• Green leaf manuring 
o Collecting green leaves from all available sources and using for manuring 
 
Importance of green manuring 
1. Leguminous green manure fix atmospheric nitrogen 
1. Green leaf additions 20-40 kg N 
2. Root fixes 5-20kg 
3. There is saving in the N budget 
2. They decompose easily without leaving much residue 
1. Cattle manure leaves more humus than GM 
3. Leguminous green manure fix atmospheric nitrogen 
1. Green leaf additions 20-40 kg N 
2. Root fixes 5-20kg 
3. There is saving in the N budget 
4. They decompose easily without leaving much residue 
1. Cattle manure leaves more humus than GM 
5. GM withdraws plant nutrients from lower layers and leaves on surface 
6. Subsidiary objectives of GM are: 
1. They are ‘catch crop’ to the nutrients being lost before next crop 
2. Shade crop: to provide shade in young orchards besides adding N 
3. Cover crop: Clothing the soil with vegetative cover in hill slopes during 
rainy season 
1. Also to check wind erosion 
4. Forage crop: few cuttings as fodder and then as GM  
1. Pillipesara (Phaseolus trilobus) is broadcast in standing rice 
 
Green manuring possibilities 
• Rainfed dry lands 
o Only hardy crops 
o Or where there is high rainfall 
• Irrigated dry lands 
o It has to be fitted between two main crops 
o GM crop should be quick growing and producning heavy foliage in short 
period 
o It should be leguminous crop 
o Capable of raising with little cost 
• Wetlands

 50% of buffaloes  
 More than 120 million goats and  
 60 million sheep (Deb Roy, 1993) 
• Natural gracing is limited?! 
o Whether to go for forage or green manure? 
o Crop wastes are recycled & but limited 
• Hence  
o Exclusive cultivation and agronomic managements like

Temperate Forages 
 
Treeless grassland predominate the temperate regions & it comprises about 24% of the 
world vegetation. 
 
The temperate forages is classified into  
• Temperate grasses 
• Temperate legumes 
1. Temperate grasses: 
• Most of the grasses found in temperate region belongs to festucoid 
(Poaoid)group. 
• Growth of temperate grasses start at the onset  of spring season varying from 
april to june depending upon the altitude. 
• Their growth rate vary from zero in winter to the full genetic potential in 
spring. 
• Example. Crested wheat grass,Intermediate wheat grass,Drooping wheat 
grass,Common bent grass,Meadow fox-tail grass,false oat grass,false  brome 
grass,rescue grass,smooth brome grass,bush grass,rice grass,Timothy 
grass,muhly grass, perennial rye grass etc…. 
 
Some important temperate grasses are  
Agropyron intermedium (Intermediate wheat grass)   
• A long lived rhizomatous turf forming temperate perennial grass native of 
Europe &asia. 
• Adapted to temperate dry region having<500mm annual rain fall 
&requires well drained and good soil. 
• Starts growth in spring &provides palatable herbage till early flowering 
stage. 
• Yield-4-6t DM/ha in 3-4 cuttings. 
• It is less drought &frost resistant than crested wheat grass,but stays green 
longer. 
• Suitable for planting in dry temperate regions of Himalayas. 
• Superior varieties:Slate,Ree,,Amur,Chief,Clarke,Tegmar etc.. 
Alopecurus pratensis (Meadow fox-tail grass) 
• Along-lived ,tufted perennial temperate grass native of europe& asia. 
• Adapted tocool,moist temperate climates,very resistant to cold &also 
withstands high summer temperature. 
• Grows best on deep,moist,fertile soils 
• Grows well under shade too. 
• Yield-5-6t DM/ha in 3-4 cuttings.

• A good pasture grass in the subtropical winter rainfall region during the 
cool season,&in tropical highlands. 
Field Crop (Kharif)
www.AgriMoon.Com
105
"
"• Yield-5-6tDM/ha. 
• Satisfactory quality of herbage with 4.1 to 4.3%D.C.P(digestible crude 
protein)&highly palatable. 
• Superior varieties:lamont,nakuru,chapelhill,grassland matua etc…   
Calamagostis epigejos (bushgrass or small reed) 
• A tuft or tussock forming temperate perennial grass, native of 
asia&Europe. 
• A coarse grass of open places  found in dry habitats such as sandy 
shores,rocky slopes or onheavy clay soil. 
• Herbage is not considered to be very palatable but is grazed by hill 
cattle,sheep&goats. 
• Yield-4-5t/ha/yr. 
Pennisetum flaccidum (pennisetum grass) 
• A tufted perennial grass of temperate & alpine region, having creeping 
rootstock. 
• It is common in higher alpine slope areas in Himalayas grazed by sheep & 
goats & is considered as good fodder. 
• DM of 3-4t/ha/yr. 
Phleum pratense(Timothy grass) 
• It is shallow rooting growing best on moist heavy soils. 
• Adapted to cool, humid climates. 
• Available for hay making as it is not so regenerative. 
• High palatability with DM of 3.2 to 6.9t/ha&crude protein of 7.2 to 
14.5%. 
• Superior varieties:kamot, bounty, pecora, champs , AberystwythS 352,                
S 48,etc… 
2. Temperate legumes: 
• In general, temperate legumes are frost resistant& low temperature 
damages their foliage donot. 
•  They are generally long day plants. 
• Legumes of temperate region in general, are more specific in their 
Rhizobium requirements than tropical species. 
• Example: Cicer milk vetch, crown vetch, birds foot trefoil, Lucerne, sweet 
clover white flowered, yellowflowered, sainfoin,honey clover, straw-berry 
clover, crimson clover, red clover etc… 
Some important temperate legumes are seen below 
Medicago sativa (Lucerne or alfalfa) 
• Al ready discussed above

• A long-lived,deep rooted,frost&drought tolerant,herbaceous perennial 
legume  native of asia. 
• New shoots arise from creeping rootstock or underground rhizomes. 
• Yield-3-4t/ha&it’s regeneration is slower than alfalfa. 
• Best suited to permeable, well drained calcareous soil. 
• It’s digestibility is higher than Lucerne&it’s seed production in crown 
vetch is 100kg/ha.

 Provides nutritious feed and pods rich in proteins and  minerals to livestock's 
 Variety of products - fuel, timber, fibre & medicine 
 Source of organic matter, increases soil N & soil structure 
 Serves as fence/ hedge 
 Serves as wind break 
•  to prevent soil erosion and conserve soil moisture 
 Provides shade for shade living plants 
 Increase the yield and improve the quality of grasses

"
"Hay making 
 
“Hay -refers to cereals, grasses or legumes that are harvested at appropriate stage, dried 
and stored” 
– High quality hay is light grey color 
– Leafy, pliable & free from mustiness 
– Easy method of storing seasonal excess 
– Only way for farm by-products 
– Principle is to reduce water content 
– Legume, non-legume & mixed gay are the major three types 
Field method 
– In field there are two methods 
– Windrows – occupies 1/3rd land area 
– Swath – Entire field 
– Drying in ‘Windrows’ faster than swath 
– For this, harvest few hrs after dew drying 
– Allowed to cure in the field itself 
– Turned after every 4-5 hrs 
– By the evening moisture reduced (75% to 40%) 
– Next day requires 1 or 2 turnings 
– Moisture content in the 2nd day comes to 25% 
– Now ready for storage as bales or in tripod stand 
– End of curing moisture to be reduced to 20% 
– Normally 70-75 sunshine hrs require 
– Not suitable for rainy season 
Mechanical method 
– Fence method – wire fencing with angle iron posts are used 
– More suitable for berseem, Lucerne, groundnut haulms and legume 
fodders 
– Protein loss is minimized (2-3%) 
– Forced air batch – developed at IGFRI 
– Capacity 1 t /day 
– Cost Rs.60/t 
Chemical changes in hay making 
– Conversion of soluble sugars to CO2 & H2O 
– Loss of digestibility 
– Increase in cellulose and lignin content 
– Reduce in nutritive and keeping quality 
Loss in fodder value 
– Nutrient loss in late cutting 
– Shattering of leaves & finer parts (in legumes) 
– Fermentation loss leads to dry mass loss by 6% 
– Oxidation by sun bleaching leads to 
– Loss of chlorophyll and carotene 
Field Crop (Kharif)
www.AgriMoon.Com
109
"
" Carotene decreases from 150-200 to 5-10ppm 
 Carotene is to give aroma 
– Animals are color blind 
– Leaching leads to loss of  
– Protein, nitrogen free extract (NFE), minerals, and vitamins 
– Consequently crude fibre increases & digestibility deceases 
– In Berseem crude protein loss is from 22% to 16-18% 
 
Ensilage / Silage making 
 
‘Silage’ may be defined as the green succulent roughage preserved under controlled 
anaerobic fermentation in the absence of oxygen by compacting green chops in air and 
watertight receptacles 
– Silage leads to fermentation of water soluble carbohydrates  to organic acids 
which increases acidity of the materials (pH – 4) 
– Such anaerobic acid (lactic acid) arrests the 
– growth of bacteria 
– Moulds 
– Inactivates putrefying organisms (act as preservative) 
– Consequently reduces nutrient losses and  
– Change in nutritive value 
– Best method than hay 
Crops suitable for silage 
– Crops suitable are based  
– Dry matter of 30-45% 
– Soluble sugar 8-10% 
– Ratio between water soluble CHOs and buffer capacity 
– Ratio of sugars to crude protein 
 All these decide production of lactic acid 
– Crops suitable for cut at 50% flowering and at milking 
 Crops like sorghum, maize 
Crops suitable for silage 
– Crops suitable are based  
– Dry matter of 30-45% 
– Soluble sugar 8-10% 
– Ratio between water soluble CHOs and buffer capacity 
– Ratio of sugars to crude protein 
 All these decide production of lactic acid 
– Crops suitable for cut at 50% flowering and at milking 
 Crops like sorghum, maize 
Points for consideration while ensiling 
– 
Dry matter content for the materials should be 30-45% 
– 
More succulent materials may be taken after field drying only 
– 
Polythene layering on all sides improves the quality 
– 
Filling should be done on a clear day as quickly as possible 
Field Crop (Kharif)
www.AgriMoon.Com
110
"
"– 
Filling should be in layers of 20-30cm at a time and uniformly 
– 
Compaction must be perfect 
– 
Trampling is useful to remove air pockets 
– 
Top must be convex / dome 
– 
Silage pit size 
• 20 x 20 x 20 c. ft for 50-55 t 
• 5 x 5 x 6 c. ft for 22.5 t 
• 10 x 5 x 6 c. ft for 45.0 t  
Characteristics of good silage 
– No mould growth 
– Golden / greenish yellow 
– Pleasant fruity odour or acceptable aroma 
– Free flowering and non-sticky texture 
– 3-4% increased palatability 
– Increased nutritive value 
– pH around 4.0 – 4.5 
– Lactic acid proportionally more than other acids 
– Decrease in nitrate-N and increase in ammoniacal-N 
– Ammoniacal N should not exceed more than 15% of the total N 
Haylage 
– It is low moisture silage (40-45%) 
– Made from grass / legume that is wilted to reduce moisture content 
– But for moisture it is almost silage  
 
Fortification of Fodder 
 
‘Fortification or enriching is the direct addition of feed supplements to the poor quality 
roughage to improve its fodder value’ 
– Mixing green legume with fodder 
– Mixing liquid ammonia (2.5 to 3.0%) 
– Mixing Urea molasses 
– 2-3% for concentrates 
– 1% of dry matter 
– After mixing similar to silage  
Fortifying materials and usage 
• Molasses for rice, wheat 
• Mineral mixture and salt for low grade grass hay 
• Urea for sorghum & maize green fodder 
• Tapioca powder/ maize powder for leguminous fodder 
• Bacteria and / fungi for dried ground nut haulms 
Advantages of Fortification 
• Improves palatability 
• Reduces wastage 
• Improves rumen environment 
• Increases crude protein
