INTRODUCTION
Psychology is concerned with almost all aspects of our lives. That is why, every
one is interested to know about psychology. But, there are many misconceptions
about psychology. Many people think that psychology deals with treating mad
people. Some others feel that psychologists can read your mind just by looking
at you or your face/forehead. They tend to equate psychologists with astrologers,
gemologists, numerologists, palmists or graphologists, who claim to solve your
problems of life and predict your future.
You might have heard the terms ‘psychology’, ‘psychological’, ‘mental’ etc., but
do you know what is the meaning of psychology and how did it evolve? Is
psychology a ‘science’ or ‘art’? What is science and what are its characteristics?
What is the subject matter of psychology? In this unit you will find answer to
these and many more such questions.
By studying psychology, you will be able to understand what psychology is and
what it is not. This unit introduces the subject of psychology.

PSYCHOLOGY: ITS ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION
The origin of psychology dates back to 1870s. The term ‘Psychology’ is derived
from two Greek words; Psyche means “soul or breath” and Logos means
“knowledge or study” (study or investigation of something). The word
‘Psychology’ was not in common use before the nineteenth century, and the field
of psychology did not actually become an independent science until the middle
of the nineteenth century.
Psychology emerged as an independent academic discipline in 1879, when a
German Professor Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychology laboratory at
the university of Leipzig, Germany. According to Bolles (1993), Wundt was a
medical doctor by training and early in his career, he was fortunate to work with
some of the great physiologists of the nineteenth century. Fittingly, his laboratory
was established during the time he spent as a professor of philosophy. (Remember,
the intellectual roots of psychology lie at the union of philosophy and physiology).
Wundt is traditionally recognised as the founder, or father of the modern
psychology, and 1879 is seen as the year that psychology finally emerged as a
unique field. Prior to Wundt, it was not possible to major in psychology, because
there were no official psychologists or psychology departments. Wundt started
studying the structure of mind which meant the immediate (conscious) experience,
the contents and processes of subjective experience such as sensations, thoughts,
feelings and emotions.
Thus, formally, psychology was recognised as an independent science in 1879.
Let us now look at how psychology has been defined.
1.3
DEFINITION OF PSYCHOLOGY
Psychology has been defined in a number of ways by various authors.
Psychologists had been debating on whether psychology should focus on “mind”,
“consciousness” or “behaviour”. Let us look at how the definitions of psychology
have come a long way over the past 130 years.
1.3.1
Early Definitions
According to Bagga & Singh (1990), the term Psychology was first used by
Rudolf Goeckle, in 1950. They have chronologically given the definitions of
psychology.
Earlier, psychology was part of Philosophy. Ancient philosophers were interested
in the study of the soul. Thus, it was first defined in terms of ‘the science of
soul’. However, since the term ‘soul’ has very wide and comprehensive meanings,
"
"7
Introduction, Definition and
Concept of Psychology
it was considered as a vague term and was criticized severely, in the middle ages.
There were questions regarding the physical existence, weight, and volume of
soul.
Dandapani (2004) states that “people were rather naïve to believe in esoteric
terms such as Soul, Mind and Consciousness. It was believed, and rightly so,
that every human being is endowed with a Soul that would remain sublime at all
times. To a philosopher soul is the firm foundation upon which ethical values
are erected. Realisation of one’s soul was considered the chief mission of
life……….. Definition of Psychology as the study of soul became unacceptable
primarily because no convincing proof or evidence of the precise nature of soul
was furnished. It was discarded because of its METAPHYSICAL nature. It was
found inadequate to satisfy the canons of science;…….”.
Thus, this definition was not accepted by psychologists.
Next, psychology was defined in terms of ‘the science of mind’, by some ancient
Greek philosophers. According to them, psychology was held as a branch of
mental philosophy. Since this definition does not include overt behaviour of
human beings and mind cannot be measured directly, this definition was also
dropped by psychologists.
Then, psychology was defined as ‘the science of consciousness’. According to
Bagga & Singh (1990), at one time during the history of Psychology, it was felt
that the main business of Psychology was to the conscious experience.
Consciousness makes us conscious or aware of the situation or a thing around
us. This definition too is now obsolete and it has been rejected due to the following
reasons:
Consciousness cannot be studied objectively as it is more personal and subjective.
Second objection came from the fast developing branch of the abnormal
psychology which brought the study of unconscious part of our mind within the
province of Psychology.
The term consciousness does not include animal or human behaviour.
The term consciousness also was supposed to have a philosophical-tinge and
not accepted by the modern scientific minded psychologists.
Finally, modern Psychology has been defined as ‘a science of behaviour.’ In the
early decades of twentieth century, Watson, the father of the school of
‘Behaviourism’, defined psychology as ‘the study of behaviour’. According to
Morgan et al. (1986), Watson rejected mind as the subject of psychology and
insisted that psychology be restricted to the study of behaviour – the observable
(or potentially observable) activities of people and animals. Watson held that
there are no essential differences between human and animal behaviour and that
we can learn much about our own behaviour from the study of what animals do.
Watson emphasised that nothing is innate and everything can be learned.
In this context, Woodworth (1948) had earlier stated that, first psychology lost
its soul, then its mind, then it lost its consciousness. It still has behaviour of sort.
As we will see below, the term ‘behaviour’ is still there in almost all the modern
definitions.

1.3.2
Current Definitions
Hilgard, Atkinson, & Atkinson (1975) have compiled the changing definitions
of psychology starting from that of William James (1890) to that of Kenneth
Clark and George Miller (1970). Bagga & Singh (1990) have also cited the
following two definitions of Woodworth and Munn, respectively:
“Psychology is the scientific study of the activities of the individual in relation
to his environment”.
“Psychology today concerns itself with the scientific investigation of behaviour,
including from the stand-point of behaviour, much of what earlier psychologists
dealt with as experience”.
Some of the more recent definitions of Psychology, in chronological order, are
as follows:

Psychology is the science of human and animal behaviour. It includes the
application of this science to human problems. (Morgan et al., 1986)

The scientific study of behaviour and mental processes. (Feldman,1996)

The scientific study of behaviour and mental processes and how they are
affected by an organism’s physical state, mental state and external
environment (Tavris and Wade, 1997)

Psychology is all about human behaviour, about mental processes, and about
the context in which behaviour and mental processes occur. (Das, 1998)

The science of behaviour and mental processes. (Lahey,1998)

The science of behaviour and cognitive processes. (Baron, 1999)

Scientific study of behaviour and mind. (Nairne, 2003)

A science in which behavioural and other evidence is used to understand the
internal processes leading people (and members of other species ) to behave
as they do. (Eysenck, 2004)

The scientific study of behaviour and mental processes. (Ciccarelli &
Meyer,2006; Coon & Mitterer, 2007, 2008)

The science that studies behaviour and mental processes.( Rathus,2008)
As is evident in the above definitions, study of behaviour (human and animal)
has been emphasised in all of them. In addition, most authors have also included
‘cognitive/mental processes’ in their definitions of psychology. But, what is
behaviour? We will now look at the nature and characteristics of behaviour.
1.3.3
Nature and Characteristics of Behaviour
Behaviour is a broad term and a complex phenomenon. In this section, we will
discuss the nature and characteristics of behaviour. According to psychologists,
behaviour is every thing or any thing that a human being or animal does that can
be observed in some way. In other words, behaviour includes all actions and
responses of organisms that can be measured directly or indirectly. Behaviour
not only means bodily movements but also can include mental and cognitive
processes such as feelings, attitudes, thoughts, emotions, and all other internal
vents, which cannot be observed directly but can be measured indirectly through
what people say (vocal behaviour) and how they react to different problems and
situations.
"

Introduction, Definition and
Concept of Psychology
We will now consider some of the general characteristics of human behaviour,
as described by Parameswaran & Beena (1988, 2002). These are:

Behaviour is influenced by a number of factors
Behaviour is influenced by a number of factors such as biological, cultural, social,
environmental, past experience, motivational, emotional, cognitive (e.g. feelings,
emotions, motivation, thoughts) etc.

Behaviour varies in complexity
Behaviour can be as simple as picking a pen, waving a friend or reflex responses
like sneezing etc. Some other behaviours include certain skills which become a
habit over a period such as playing guitar, cycling etc. Yet some other behaviours
involve complex activities like repairing a car. Activities such as landing on the
moon, flying a fighter plane, rock climbing etc. are some of the examples of
highly complex behaviour.

The factors influencing behaviour are of different kinds
Behaviour is influenced by two large sets of factors:
i)
Those belonging to the individual; and
ii)
Those belonging to the environment.
Factors pertaining to an individual can be categorized under physiological
(biological needs such as hunger, thirst etc.) and psychological ( ideas, opinions,
attitudes etc.).
The environmental factors include physical surroundings, family and friends,
the larger society and even the overall cultural and social background.

Individual differences
Behaviour also varies from one person to the other as well as from one group of
people to the other group of people. People differ in their physiological and
bodily conditions, in their past experiences, in their abilities, in their background
etc. It is therefore, natural that if ten people are put in same situation, each person’s
behaviour differs from that of others, in some respects or in some degrees.

Behaviour also shows similarities
Though behaviour differs from person to person but this does not mean that all
people differ from all others, at all times, and in all situations. There is also a
considerable degree of similarity in behaviour among people. For instance, if a
particle of dust falls into a person’s eye, he/she tries to remove it. This type of
behaviour is universally found.

Behaviour is always purposeful and goal directive
Human behaviour is always purposeful and one’s actions are always directed
towards some goal or the other. A boy sitting and studying suddenly gets up and
takes a glass of water. Here, the goal is to have a glass of water and the purpose
is to quench his thirst. On the other hand, a boy is sitting and studying and feels
cold. He gets up and switches off the fan. Here the goal is to switch off the fan
and the purpose is to avoid the discomfort of cold. So, all our behaviours can be
categorized under:
"
"10
Introduction to Psychology,
Objectives, Goals
i)
Approach behaviour (Positive goal directed) or
ii)
Avoidance behaviour (Negative goal avoidance)

Behaviour is changeable to a large extent
It was mentioned earlier that a number of factors influence behaviour. In view of
this, it is possible to change behaviour by modifying these factors. It is this
changeability which enables a child to become adult, a bad man to become a
good man and a good man to become a bad man. It is again this very characteristics
which helps people to adjust to new surroundings. These changes are the results
of one’s practice or experiences (learning).

Behaviour also shows stability
Though emphasis has been laid on the possible changes in behaviour, it must be
mentioned that life is not always full of all sorts of changes. While behaviour
changes, at the same time there is also a certain stability in behaviour. It does not
change with every change in the environment nor do all forms of behaviour
change. Human behaviour shows a lot of stability. For instance, you may still
find your grandmother preferring old ideas and old ways of life, though she is
living in an ultra modern society.

Behaviour is integrated
As already mentioned, behaviour is influenced by a number of factors and a
variety of purposes. Every human being has physiological, psychological, personal
and social purposes.
He/she has also been the subject of different learning experiences. In spite of all
this, behaviour always shows an order and a hierarchy of purposes. Every
individual behaves as a total person and this process of the organisation of different
purposes, different learnings and different influencing factors results in an
integration of behaviour.
Thus, an individual put in different situations, still shows certain characteristic
ways and styles of behaviour which help us to understand and predict his/her
behaviour. We often say, Ram is a pleasant person. Gobind is an unpleasant person,
Krishna is a sociable person and so on. Psychologists use the term Personality to
describe this process of integration. The greater the degree of integration in a
person’s behaviour, the more effective his behaviour is likely to be.
It can therefore be appreciated that behaviour is a complex phenomenon and
studying behaviour is not an easy task.
1.4
PSYCHOLOGY, AS A SCIENCE
Psychology has been defined as a science of behaviour. But is it a science like
physics, chemistry, biology and zoology or some thing different? In this section
we will look at some of the definitions of science. We will also discuss the
nature and characteristics of science and understand psychology, as a science.
Let us look at the following definitions of science:

Science is a systematized body of knowledge gathered through carefully
observing and measuring events (Morgan et al.,1986).
"
"11
Introduction, Definition and
Concept of Psychology

Science is approach to knowledge, based on systematic observation
(Lahey,1998)
The sole aim of science is to classify, understand, and unify the objects and
phenomena of the material world. By using a combination of accurate observation
and experimentation, logic and intuition, scientists seek to understand the rules
that govern all levels of the natural universe. We will now describe the
characteristics of science.
1.4.1
Characteristics of Science
The observation of events are systematized in various ways, but mainly by
classifying and establishing general principles and laws to describe and predict
new events as accurately as possible. Psychology studies behaviour in the same
way that the other sciences study their subject matter and therefore shares a
number of features with them. In common with other sciences, psychology, as a
science, has the following characteristics, as described by Morgan et al. (1986).

Empirical observation
Psychology, as a science, is first of all, and above all, empirical. That is to say, it
rests on experiment and observation, rather than on argument, opinion, or belief.

Systematic approach and theory
Data from observations and experiments are essential to science, but for them
“to make some sense” in helping us to understand events, they must be ordered
in some way. The scientist tries to find a limited number of principles which will
summarize the data economically. Scientific theories are important tools for the
organisation of data.

Measurement
Another distinguishing feature of many sciences is measurement, defined as
assignment of numbers to objects or events according to certain rules. Physics is
ranked highest (most scientific) among the sciences as it has developed the most
precise measurements.

Definition of terms
Careful definition of terms is essential to clear thinking in science. The procedure
in psychology is to define concepts by relating them to observable behaviour
(operational definition). When we define a concept operationally, we define it in
terms of measurable and observable operations. For example, the concepts of
length, height in physics, and concepts like intelligence, motivation, personality
in psychology are defined in terms of observable operations, which can be
performed to measure them. However, psychology cannot measure many
behaviours such as bravery, friendship, love, beauty etc. as these cannot be defined
operationally.
The above characteristics are common to all sciences including psychology.
However, psychology is a different type of science (Behavioural science). In
physics or chemistry, researchers investigate processes and events which remain
stable and constant to a large extent. This makes it possible to measure and
predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy. But it is not the case with human
behaviour, which is highly complex, not easily controllable, and appears to be
"
"12
Introduction to Psychology,
Objectives, Goals
much more unpredictable than the reactions of physical and chemical substances.
Whereas other sciences investigate things around man, psychology studies man
himself. The methods used in psychological research include observation,
interviews, psychological testing, laboratory experimentation, and statistical
analysis.
Thus, psychology is categorized under the youngest group of scientific inquiry,
the ‘Social/Behavioural Sciences’, which also includes subjects like anthropology,
economics, education, geography, history, linguistics, sociology etc.(Rush, 1972).
The first group of sciences are the ‘Physical Sciences’, which include subjects
like physics, chemistry etc. Next is the ‘Biological / Life Sciences’ that include
such subjects as biology, botany, zoology etc.
The application of knowledge to practical problems is an art; it is the skill or
knack for doing things which is acquired by study, practice and special experience.
Since principles and laws of psychology are applied to solve human problems in
a number of situations (families, schools, organisations, environment) as well as
treating behaviour disorders and emotional problems, it is also an art.
1.4.2
Psychology: What it is and what it is not
Psychology is an exciting field. It is at once familiar, exotic, surprising, and
challenging. Most of all, psychology is changing. Psychology is about each of
us. It asks us to take a reflective attitude as we inquire, “How can we step outside
of ourselves to look objectively at how we live, think, feel, and act?” psychologists
believe the answer is through careful thought, observation, and inquiry. (Coon &
Mitterer, (2008).
According to Parameswaran & Beena (2002), some people regard psychology as
a part of philosophy. Others equate it with magic. Some view it as madness. Still
others are of the opinion that psychologists are either mystics or mysterious
people, their interest in psychology mainly arises from uninformed curiosity.
They are of the view that if they studied psychology, they would learn about
miracles, mysteries, madness and that it would be an exotic experience. Many of
them feel that the main use of psychology is in treating mentally ill individuals.
While certainly this is an important area of application, it is not the only area.
Today, psychology finds useful applications in an individual’s life almost from
the womb to the tomb.
Psychology, like all academic disciplines, has its own concepts such as intelligence,
personality, stress, learning, memory, thinking, perception etc. Many of the
concepts of psychology are familiar to you, but many of them are new. The
topics included in psychology are: the nervous system, sensation and perception,
learning and memory, intelligence, language and thinking, growth and
development, motivation and emotion, personality, stress, psychological disorders,
ways of treating those disorders, sexual behaviour, and the behaviour of people
in social settings such as groups and organisations.
The goals of psychology, like other sciences, are to describe, explain, predict
and control (Coon & Mitterer, 2008) the phenomena it studies. Psychology, thus,
attempts to describe, explain, predict and control behaviour and mental processes.
Psychology as a science of behaviour, attempts to explain the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of
behaviour. The knowledge of psychology can also be applied to solve various
"
"13
Introduction, Definition and
Concept of Psychology
problems facing human beings, be it at home, society, work place or in the whole
world. However, there are many ‘professionals’ who practice applying psychology
without any type of training in psychology. They are somewhat like quacks or
‘jhola chhap’ doctors. They may be called ‘pseudo-psychologists’. In order to
further clarify, let us describe some of the pseudo-psychologies.
1.4.3
Pseudo-Sciences/Pseudo-Psychology
A gemologist, graphologist, numerologist, palmist or an astrologer, all claim to
solve your problems of life and predict your future. They seem to be psychologists.
But these disciplines are categorized under “pseudo- psychology” or “pseudo-
sciences”.
A Pseudopsychology is any unfounded system that superficially resembles
psychology. Many pseudopsychologies give the appearance of science but are
actually false. (Pseudo means “false”). Pseudopsychologies change little over
time because their followers avoid evidence that contradicts their beliefs.
Scientists, in contrast, actively look for contradictionsas a way to advance
knowledge. They are skeptical critics of their own theories (Schick & Vaughn,
2001).
Descriptions of some of the pseudo-psychologies are given below:
1)
Palmistry: False system that claims to reveal personality traits and to predict
the future by “reading” lines on the palms of the hands. It is also called
‘chiromancy’. ‘Chiromancy’ comes from the Greek word for hand (Cheir).
The most famous 19th century palmist, went by the name of Cheiro.
Palmistry is the practice of telling fortunes from the lines, marks and patterns
on the hands, particularly, the palms.
2)
Phrenology: False and antiquated system based on the belief that personality
traits are revealed by the shape of the skull. Phrenology was started in the
19th century by a German anatomy teacher, Franz Gall. His theory -
‘Personality was revealed by bumps on the skull’.

Phrenologists assumed that parts of the brain governed different
personality characteristics.

Like muscles, parts of the brain that were used more often, tended to get
bigger. In turn, these enlarged areas pushed on the skull causing bumps.

With advances in Neurology, this was shown to be impossible, and
phrenology declined.

Although some brain areas do have specific functions, they are not
directly related to specific personality traits.
3)
Graphology: False system based on the belief that handwriting can reveal
personality traits.

Indicates that personality is revealed by a person’s handwriting.

Some companies in USA use handwriting analysis to evaluate job
applicants.

Definitely, valuable in detecting forgeries.

Careful test of accuracy in psychological studies have shown that
graphologists score close to zero in rating personality.

4)
Numerology: False system based on the belief that personality traits are
revealed by certain numbers, usually birthdays ( date, month and year ).They
are the database from which a numerologist is able to describe you, sight
unseen. Number values are assigned to the letters in your name. By adding
these, with the numbers in your birth date, in a multitude of combinations,
a numerologist establishes your key numbers. He then interprets the meaning
of these key numbers, which results in a complete description of your
personal characteristics.
5)
Astrology: False system based on the belief that human behaviour is
influenced by the position of planets and stars. It is based on the assumption
that the position of the planets and stars at the time of a person’s birth
determines personality characteristics and affects behaviour.
In its modern guise, astrology is based on the assertion that the apparent positions
of certain objects in the solar system at the time an individual is born, are somehow
correlated with his or her personality, activities, preferences and even major life
events such as marriages, divorces, accidents etc.
Pseudo-psychologies are not supported by scientific evidence. Belief in pseudo-
psychologies is based on the following thinking errors:
i)
Uncritical acceptance: The tendency to believe generally positive or flattering
descriptions of oneself.
ii)
Fallacy of positive instances: The tendency to remember or notice information
that fits one’s expectations, while forgetting discrepancies.
iii) Barnum effect: The tendency to consider a personal description accurate if
it is stated in general terms. (Coon & Mitterer, 2008).
Psychology is neither common sense nor pseudoscience. Contrary to pseudo-
sciences scientific psychology is based on objectivity, empirical evidence and
critical thinking.

1.4.4
Principles of Critical Thinking
According to Rathus (2008), psychologists are guided by scientific principles,
and one hallmark of science is critical thinking. A group of psychologists
(McGovern 1989) defined the goals of critical thinking as fostering the following
thinking skills:
"
"15
Introduction, Definition and
Concept of Psychology

Development of skepticism about explanations and conclusions.

The ability to inquire about causes and events.
i)
Increased curiosity about behaviour
ii)
Knowledge about research methods.
iii) The ability to analyse arguments critically.
According to Beyer (1995), critical thinking means reasoned judgments (logical
and well thought out judgments).
Let us now consider some principles of critical thinking, as pointed out by Rathus
(2008). These are as follows:
1)
Be skeptical: Keep an open mind. Politicians and advertisers try to persuade
you. Accept nothing as the truth until you have examined the evidence.
2)
Examine definition of term: Some statements are true when a term is
defined in one way but not when the term is defined in another way. So try
to follow the real meaning of a term.
3)
Examine the assumptions or premises of arguments: Consider the
statement that one can not learn about human beings by engaging in research
with animals. One premise in the statement seems to be that human beings
are not animals. One premise in the statement seems to be that human beings
are not animals. We are, of course, social animals.
4)
Be cautious from drawing conclusion from evidence: Suppose you see a
driver drinking, before he/she met with an accident. You are too quick to
draw a conclusion that ‘drinking was the cause of accident’. However, there
may be other causes such as bad road , mechanical failure or fault of the
other driver. One or more of which might have been the cause of the accident.
5)
Consider alternative interpretations of research evidence: You read a
statement based on a research that, frustration leads to aggression. However,
all frustrated people are not necessarily aggressive. Similarly, aggressive
behaviour is not due to frustration alone. Though research evidence is
accepted without question, researchers may differ in their interpretation of
the same. So, you must think of other alternative interpretations of results
rather than blindly accepting the explanation given by a researcher.
6)
Do not over simplify: Most human behaviour involves complex interaction
of genetic and environmental influences. Also consider the issue of whether
psychopathy helps people with psychological problems. A broad answer to
this question? simple yes or no ? might be over simplifying. It is more
worthwhile to ask, What type of psychopathy, practiced by whom, is most
helpful, for what kind of problem?
7)
Do not over generalise: Consider the statement that one can not learn about
human beings by engaging in research with non human animals. Is the truth
of the matter an all-or-nothing issue.
8)
Apply critical thinking to all areas of life: A skeptical attitude and a demand
for evidence are not only useful in college but are of value in all areas of
life. Be skeptical when you are bombarded by TV commercials, or when
political causes try to sweep you up or when you see the latest cover stories
about unidentified flying objects etc.

Introduction to Psychology,
Objectives, Goals
These are the kinds of principles that guide psychologists’ thinking as they observe
behaviour, engage in research, or advise clients, as to how to improve the quality
of their lives. Now let us look at the nature of tasks psychologists are engaged in.
1.4.5
The Tasks of Psychology
Parameswaran & Beena (2002) have suggested the tasks of psychology, which
are described as follows:
1)
Firstly, a science of behaviour should observe, investigate and identify factors
which influence behaviour and also assess their relative influences.
2)
It must investigate the role of each of these factors, separately and together
in producing similarities and differences in behaviour.
3)
Based on these investigations, psychology should arrive at generalisations
in the form of theories, laws and principles explaining the similarities and
also the differences in behaviour
4)
It should also explain the complimentary functions of the factors and the
processes, in generating similarities as well as differences among people.
5)
Since behaviour is purposive, psychology must investigate the nature, kinds
and number of purposes, their origin and development, and the relationship
among them.
6)
Since behaviour changes, it is the responsibility of psychology to study and
explain the nature of such changes, kinds, the processes which govern them
and the interaction among different kinds of changes.
7)
While changes in behaviour are to be understood, stability and consistency
in behaviour also need to be explained.
8)
The master concern of psychology is to explain how change and stability,
similarities and differences, are organised and integrated to produce both
generality and uniqueness in behaviour.
Psychologists are engaged in the above tasks, and they are thus, quite different
from pseudo-psychologists.

LET US SUM UP
We have discussed the origin and evolution of psychology as an independent
academic discipline. We have also defined psychology and discussed the nature
and characteristics of science and behaviour.
Further, we have also discussed the meaning and concept of psychology, and the
principles of critical thinking that guide psychologists. Finally, some of the
pseudo-psychologies have been described and the tasks of psychologists have
been highlighted.
This introduction to the meaning and concept of psychology is useful to students
or anybody who wants to learn psychology, in clarifying some of the
misconceptions of psychology, understand and appreciate psychology, as a
scientific discipline, and make them informed consumers of psychological
